//! Changes, observations, and receipts — the reducer's entire input/output
//! vocabulary.
//!
//! The reducer never reads clocks or RNG: [`ChangeCtx`] carries the timestamp,
//! the session identity used for deterministic ID derivation, and an optional
//! idempotency key. Same snapshot + same change + same ctx ⇒ same result,
//! always.
//!
//! Spec-silent shapes chosen minimally here (documented on each type):
//! [`WorkNodePatch`], [`WorkGraphProposal`], [`ApprovalRef`], and the
//! placeholder observation types that later slices' liveness adapters will
//! feed ([`OperationObservation`], [`OwnerState`], [`CancelOutcome`]).
