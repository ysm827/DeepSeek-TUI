//! Work Graph — the single authoritative work ledger for a session.
//!
//! One graph carries objectives, plan steps, operations, evidence, blockers,
//! and approvals. **Invariant: one graph writes every projection; projections
//! never write each other.** Plan and todo views, work-surface rows, and the
//! inspector all derive from [`WorkGraphSnapshot`] through pure functions.
//!
//! Why a graph instead of parallel trackers: flat status lists let an agent
//! mark work "done" by assertion, lose dependency structure, and cannot say
//! what evidence backed a completion. Here completion and verification are
//! distinct states, `Verified` is unreachable without a satisfying evidence
//! path (V4, fail-closed), dependencies are first-class edges (acyclic, V1),
//! and liveness truth stays with the owning subsystems — the graph records
//! observations, it never invents them.
//!
//! This slice is the core only: model, changes, pure reducer, validation.
//! Session persistence, legacy import, UI projections, and liveness adapters
//! land in later slices; nothing in the app or engine calls this yet.
// Staged cutover: later slices wire persistence, UI, and liveness; until
// then the public surface (including re-exports) has no external callers.
