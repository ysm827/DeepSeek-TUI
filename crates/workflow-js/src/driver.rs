//! The driver seam between the sandboxed VM and the subagent engine.
//!
//! The QuickJS VM lives on a dedicated thread and its `'js` values can never
//! cross an `.await` onto another thread, so everything that leaves the VM is
//! plain `Send` data: a [`TaskRequest`] goes out, a [`TaskCompletion`] comes
//! back over a oneshot. The [`WorkflowDriver`] trait is the host-side contract
//! the tui wiring implements over `SubAgentManager` (spawn is fire-and-forget
//! there; the driver's completion pump resolves the oneshot from the mailbox
//! `Completed` signal keyed by `agent_id`, then reads the full untruncated
//! text via `get_result`). Tests implement it with
//! [`crate::testing::FakeDriver`].
//!
//! Budget ownership: token accounting and the §5.3 reservation semantics live
//! entirely on the driver side (the manager's budget scopes). The VM only
//! reads [`BudgetSnapshot`]s — it performs a fast-fail `spent >= total` check
//! before spawning and exposes the numbers to JS as `budget.*`, but it never
//! reserves or debits tokens itself. A driver that admits a spawn is the
//! authority; its rejection surfaces as a JS throw on that `task()` call.
