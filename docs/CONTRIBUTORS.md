The v0.8.63 release hardened sub-agent fanout with token-budget governance and

<summary><strong>v0.8.62 — provider/model routing, TOML comment preservation &amp; community closeout</strong></summary>


The v0.8.62 release retuned provider/model routing (GLM-5.2 as the default direct
Z.AI model, `type: "explore"` sub-agents defaulting to the cheaper same-family
sibling), added TOML comment preservation and the CodeWhale-only skill discovery
