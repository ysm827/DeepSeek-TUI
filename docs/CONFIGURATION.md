# Configuration

codewhale reads configuration from a TOML file plus environment variables.
At process startup it may also load literal built-in-provider credentials from
a workspace-local `.env` file. Use the tracked `.env.example` as the template;
copy it to `.env`, then add only credential values.

A workspace is not configuration authority. Codewhale therefore ignores
config/profile/home paths, provider/model/base-URL routing, MCP/plugin state,
approval/sandbox/shell posture, executable paths, runtime settings, and every
other non-credential `.env` entry. Variable expansion is rejected so a
repository cannot substitute an ambient secret into a credential value. Use
`config.toml`, CLI flags, or values exported by the launching shell for those
explicit control-plane settings. `.env` is read from a stable regular-file
handle, is capped at 1 MiB, and symbolic links, reparse points, and multiply
linked files are rejected.

## Constitution, project instructions, and repo authority

Codewhale has several instruction surfaces. They are deliberately separate so a
personal constitution, repo policy, project instructions, and runtime security
controls do not blur together.

- **Bundled global Constitution** — the compiled base law in the binary. It is
  the default floor for every session.
- **User-global constitution** — the normal guided setup output. Manage it with
  `/constitution` or `/setup`; Codewhale stores structured data at
  `$CODEWHALE_HOME/constitution.json` (default `~/.codewhale/constitution.json`)
  and renders it into a separate `<codewhale_user_constitution>` prose block.
  This can express preferences and stop conditions, but it does not change
  runtime approval policy, sandbox, shell, network, trust, or MCP permissions.
- **Repo-local constitution** — optional project policy in
  `.codewhale/constitution.json`, described below.
- **`AGENTS.md`** — cross-agent **project instructions** (prose). This is the
  canonical file for "how should an agent work in this repo." Run `/init` to
  scaffold one. `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/instructions.md` are read as
  compatibility fallbacks.
- **Memory and handoffs** — recalled state. Useful, but lower authority than
  constitutions and project instructions.

Release verification for these surfaces lives in
[`docs/evidence/v0867-constitution-setup-qa-matrix.md`](evidence/v0867-constitution-setup-qa-matrix.md).
Use it when checking `/setup`, `/constitution`, doctor, context reports, and
the update checkpoint agree.

### Managing the user-global constitution (`/setup` and `/constitution`)

On first launch Codewhale runs a short **constitution-first** setup path:
language → provider/model readiness → runtime posture → create or confirm your
constitution. The bundled/default constitution is always valid, so you can
defer; reopen the hub any time with `/setup`.

On the **Constitution** step:

- **`1`–`6`** tune the guided draft. **`G`** previews it, and **`G`** again
  ratifies and saves a fresh structured `constitution.json`.
- **`A`** (shown only when a provider is configured) asks your first configured
  model to draft the constitution. Drafting is **not** saving: the draft is
  rendered through the same preview and you still press **`G`** to ratify
  before anything persists.
- **`K`** keeps your existing loaded constitution unchanged (shown only when a
  valid file is already present).
- **`U`** (or `/constitution bundled`) records the bundled/default law.

`/constitution` (alias `/law`) is the primary management surface once you are
set up. Subcommands: `status` (the default), `preview`, `review`, `repo` (the
repo-local law block), `explain`, `edit`/`guided`, `repair`, `posture`, and
`bundled`. Managing the constitution never changes runtime approval, sandbox,
shell, network, trust, default mode, or MCP authority — those stay in runtime
posture/config.

Each repo can carry two distinct, complementary files:

- **`AGENTS.md`** — ordinary project working instructions.
- **`.codewhale/constitution.json`** — Codewhale-specific **repo authority /
  prioritization policy**: when local sources conflict, which should Codewhale
  trust first, and what to verify before claiming a task is done. `.codewhale/`
  lives inside the repo (like `.github/`). Example:

  ```json
  {
    "schema_version": 1,
    "authority": [
      "current user request",
      "live code and tests",
      "GitHub issue/PR details",
      "AGENTS.md",
      "memory",
      "old handoffs"
    ],
    "protected_invariants": [
      "do not break old-session transcript replay"
    ],
    "branch_policy": "PRs target the integration branch, not main",
    "verification_policy": {
      "before_claiming_done": ["run focused tests", "read changed files back"]
    },
    "escalate_when": [
      "a destructive action was not explicitly authorized"
    ]
  }
  ```

  All fields are optional. When present, the file is rendered into the system
  prompt as concise prose in a higher-authority block. Legacy `WHALE.md` files
  are ignored and reported as migration-only diagnostics.

  Each `protected_invariants` entry may be either a plain string (advisory
  prose, the historical shape) or an object carrying path globs, which is
  additionally **mechanically enforced** in the tool gate. See
  [Enforced repo-law invariants](#enforced-repo-law-invariants) below.

  This is the **repo-local law** layer in Codewhale's hierarchy: *bundled global
  Constitution* → *user-global constitution* (`$CODEWHALE_HOME/constitution.json`,
  rendered as prose) → *repo constitution* (`.codewhale/constitution.json`, this
  file) → *AGENTS/project instructions* → *memory and handoffs* → *current
  request and live evidence for the active turn*. Runtime policy
  (permissions/sandbox/cost limits enforced in code) is separate from all of
  these prompt layers. The repo constitution gives project decision rules; it
  does not replace the bundled Constitution, the user-global constitution, or
  the current user request.

> **`WHALE.md` is deprecated.** It overlapped confusingly with `AGENTS.md`.
> Codewhale no longer reads `WHALE.md` as project or global context. If one is
> present, setup/context diagnostics report it as ignored so you can migrate it.
> Move ordinary instructions to `AGENTS.md` and Codewhale-specific authority
> policy to `.codewhale/constitution.json`. Personal standing guidance belongs
> in `/constitution` / `$CODEWHALE_HOME/constitution.json`. (The global
> Codewhale Constitution shipped in the model prompt is a separate thing and is
> unaffected.)

### Enforced repo-law invariants

By default a `protected_invariants` entry is advisory prose: it is rendered into
the prompt as guidance the agent should honor, but nothing stops a write. An
entry written as an **object with `paths`** is different — it compiles into a
mechanical write hold that the engine's tool gate evaluates before the write
runs. The law becomes mechanism, not just a request.

An enforced entry has this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "protected_invariants": [
    "Keep DeepSeek support first-class.",
    {
      "text": "The wire format is frozen; protocol changes need a human.",
      "paths": ["crates/protocol/**"],
      "action": "block"
    },
    {
      "text": "Release notes need human review.",
      "paths": ["CHANGELOG.md"],
      "action": "ask"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `text` — required. The reason surfaced on the hold. An empty `text` is skipped.
- `paths` — workspace-relative globs (globset syntax, e.g. `crates/protocol/**`,
  `**/secrets.toml`, `CHANGELOG.md`). An object with no usable `paths` stays
  advisory-only despite the object shape.
- `action` — optional, defaults to `ask`. `ask` force-prompts in Ask and
  Auto-Review; in Full Access it denies the protected write without opening a
  modal. `block` **denies the write outright** in every posture.

Semantics:

- **Tighten-only.** The schema has no allow/widen shape, so law can only *add*
  holds — a crafted constitution can never grant authority or weaken a gate
  above it.
- **Not bypassable by mode.** Like the built-in safety floor, an `ask` hold
  force-prompts in Ask and Auto-Review. Full Access never opens approval
  modals, so the same hold fails closed as a hard block; `block` always denies.
  Mode cannot turn a hold off.
- **Repo-local only.** Only the repo's `.codewhale/constitution.json`
  participates. The user-global constitution stays advisory prose and never
  reaches this mechanism.
- **Fails safe.** A missing file, parse error, or invalid glob degrades to
  fewer or zero rules — never a hold on unprotected paths and never a poisoned
  gate. Across matches the strongest action wins, so `block` outranks `ask`.
- **Leaves a receipt.** Every hold emits a `tool.repo_law_decision` tool-audit
  event naming the invariant, the matched path, and the source file; the
  approval/denial reason names the invariant too.

**Coverage is deliberately limited.** Holds are evaluated only for the write
tools `write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`, and `fim_edit`, and only
against the filesystem targets named in their inputs (`path`/`target`/
`destination`/`file_path`, `changes[].path`, and unified-diff /
`apply_patch`-envelope headers). A shell command that writes a protected path is **not** held by
repo law — those writes are still governed by the ordinary approval, sandbox,
and shell-write gates, not by this mechanism.

### Expert full base-prompt override (#3638)

The global Constitution (the base system prompt, normally compiled in from
`crates/tui/src/prompts/text.rs` as `BASE_PROMPT`) can be replaced per-user
without rebuilding. This is
an expert escape hatch, not the normal `/constitution` guided setup output.
Because this is a prompt trust boundary, it takes **two deliberate steps** — a
file alone is not enough:

1. Drop the replacement at `~/.codewhale/prompts/constitution.md` (under
   `$CODEWHALE_HOME` when set).
2. Set the explicit opt-in flag `CODEWHALE_ALLOW_BASE_PROMPT_OVERRIDE=1`
   (`true`/`on`/`yes` also accepted).

If the file exists but the flag is unset, the override is **ignored** (with a
log line pointing to the flag) and the bundled Constitution stays in place.
This is intended for repurposing the TUI beyond software engineering — e.g.
long-form writing or document review — where the engineering-oriented base
prompt is a poor fit. It is loaded once at startup; a **missing or empty file
is a no-op**, so existing installs keep the bundled prompt.

Scope is deliberately narrow: only the byte-stable **base prompt segment** is
overridable. Mode deltas, the approval policy, the tool taxonomy, Context
Management, and the Compaction Relay are still owned by Codewhale's runtime
assembly, so an override **cannot remove safety-relevant guidance** (sandbox,
approvals) — it only swaps the task/voice framing. To customize ordinary
personal behavior, prefer `/constitution`; to customize per-repo behavior,
prefer `AGENTS.md` + `.codewhale/constitution.json` above.

## Where It Looks

Default config path:

- `~/.codewhale/config.toml`
- Legacy fallback: `~/.deepseek/config.toml`

Overrides:

- CLI: `codewhale --config /path/to/config.toml`
- Env: `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.toml`
- Legacy env alias: `DEEPSEEK_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.toml`

If both are set, `--config` wins. Environment variable overrides are applied after the file is loaded.

### TUI editability audit

Inside the TUI, run `/config audit` to see which documented keys can be changed
from the current session, which ones can also be persisted, and which ones stay
file-only or restart-only. The audit includes current values for the high-impact
runtime controls such as `approval_policy`, `allow_shell`,
`stream_chunk_timeout_secs`, `base_url`, `mcp_config_path`, and the
`[subagents]` concurrency/depth/timeout keys.

Use the command's "Command / reason" column as the source of truth before
editing by hand. For example, `/config approval_mode on-request --save` writes
top-level `approval_policy = "on-request"`, while provider base URLs are saved
but still require restarting the model client.

### User workspace entries

Interactive Agent sessions expose shell tools by default with approval gating
unless you explicitly disable them. For a shell opt-in that should live in the
user's global config for noninteractive or durable-task profiles rather than in
the repository, add a workspace-scoped entry:

```toml
[workspace.'/absolute/path/to/project']
allow_shell = true
```

The entry applies only when the launched workspace path matches the table key.
The legacy `[projects."/absolute/path/to/project"]` table is also accepted for
this user-owned override.

In interactive mode, the per-project overlay
`<workspace>/.codewhale/config.toml` is applied after this user entry. A
project-level `allow_shell = false` can still tighten the session; project-level
`allow_shell = true` is ignored.

### Per-project overlay (#485)

When the TUI starts in a workspace that contains a regular-file
`<workspace>/.codewhale/config.toml`, the safe values declared in that file are
merged on top of the global config. Legacy
`<workspace>/.deepseek/config.toml` files are still read when the Codewhale path
is absent. Symlinked project config files are rejected. This lets a repo suggest
a model or tighten local safety posture without touching the user's
`~/.codewhale/config.toml`. Pass `--no-project-config` to skip the overlay for
one launch.

Supported keys in the project overlay (top-level fields only):

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `model` | override `default_text_model` |
| `reasoning_effort` | force `"high"` / `"max"` for a complex repo |
| `approval_policy` | only values that tighten the user's current approval posture |
| `sandbox_mode` | only values that tighten the user's current sandbox posture |
| `notes_path` | keep notes in-repo |
| `max_subagents` | clamp sub-agent concurrency for a constrained repo (clamped to 1..=20) |
| `allow_shell` | `false` can disable shell access; `true` is ignored |

The overlay is intentionally narrow — it covers the fields a repo
maintainer is most likely to want to standardize across contributors.
Credential, endpoint, provider-selection, MCP config, hooks, skills, capacity,
retry, hotbar bindings, and `instructions = [...]` settings stay user-global.
If a repo-local config declares `api_key`, `base_url`, `provider`,
`mcp_config_path`, `hotbar`, `allow_shell = true`, or `instructions`,
Codewhale ignores that key and keeps the user's global setting.

The `codewhale` facade and `codewhale-tui` binary share the same config file for
DeepSeek auth and model defaults. `codewhale auth set --provider deepseek` (and
the legacy `codewhale login --api-key ...` alias) saves the key to
`~/.codewhale/config.toml` (migrating legacy `~/.deepseek/config.toml` on first
launch when needed), and `codewhale --model deepseek-v4-flash` is forwarded to
the TUI as `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`.

Credential lookup uses `config -> keyring -> env` after any explicit CLI
`--api-key`. Run `codewhale auth status` to inspect the active provider's config
file, OS keyring backend, environment variable, winning source, and last-four
label without printing the key itself. The command only probes the active
provider's keyring entry.

For hosted, generic OpenAI-compatible, self-hosted, OpenAI Responses, or native
Anthropic providers, set `provider = "<id>"` or pass
`codewhale --provider <id>`. The canonical provider IDs are `deepseek`,
`nvidia-nim`, `openai`, `atlascloud`, `wanjie-ark`, `volcengine`,
`openrouter`, `xiaomi-mimo`, `novita`, `fireworks`, `siliconflow`, `arcee`,
`siliconflow-CN`, `moonshot`, `sglang`, `vllm`, `ollama`, `huggingface`,
`together`, `qianfan`, `openai-codex`, `anthropic`, `openmodel`, `zai`,
`stepfun`, `minimax`, and `deepinfra`.
For the provider-by-provider registry, including wire protocol, auth variables,
default base URLs, model IDs, and capability metadata, see
[PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md).
The facade saves provider credentials to the shared user config and forwards
the resolved key, base URL, provider, and model to the TUI process. Use
`codewhale auth set --provider nvidia-nim --api-key "YOUR_NVIDIA_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider openai --api-key "YOUR_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider atlascloud --api-key "YOUR_ATLASCLOUD_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider wanjie-ark --api-key "YOUR_WANJIE_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider xiaomi-mimo --api-key "YOUR_XIAOMI_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider fireworks --api-key "YOUR_FIREWORKS_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider siliconflow --api-key "YOUR_SILICONFLOW_API_KEY"` or
`codewhale auth set --provider arcee --api-key "YOUR_ARCEE_API_KEY"` or the
matching provider ID from [PROVIDERS.md](PROVIDERS.md) to save provider keys
through the facade. The generic `openai` provider defaults
to `https://api.openai.com/v1`, accepts `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and defaults to
`deepseek-v4-pro` for OpenAI-compatible gateways. `atlascloud` defaults to
`https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1`, accepts `ATLASCLOUD_BASE_URL`, and uses
`deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash` as its default model. `wanjie-ark` targets
Wanjie Ark's OpenAI-compatible endpoint at
`https://maas-openapi.wanjiedata.com/api/v1`, defaults to `deepseek-reasoner`,
and passes model IDs through unchanged because Wanjie model access is
account-scoped. SGLang, vLLM, and Ollama are
self-hosted and can run without an API key by default. Ollama defaults to
`http://localhost:11434/v1` and sends model tags such as `codewhale-coder:1.3b`
or `qwen2.5-coder:7b` unchanged. Self-hosted providers and loopback custom
URLs (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `0.0.0.0`) do not read the secret store
unless API-key auth is explicitly requested; use an env var or config-file key
when a local server does require bearer auth.
SiliconFlow defaults to `https://api.siliconflow.com/v1`, accepts
`SILICONFLOW_BASE_URL`, and uses `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` by default.
`provider = "siliconflow-CN"` selects the China regional default
`https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` with the `[providers.siliconflow_cn]` table and
`SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` credential slot.
Arcee AI defaults to `https://api.arcee.ai/api/v1`, accepts `ARCEE_BASE_URL`,
and uses `trinity-large-thinking` by default for Codewhale agent work.
`trinity-large-preview` is also listed as a direct Arcee API model; OpenRouter's
`arcee-ai/trinity-large-thinking` remains the OpenRouter namespaced form, while
the direct Arcee provider uses the bare `trinity-large-thinking` ID. Direct
Arcee large-model API calls are tracked as 256K-context BF16 serving; Thinking
is reasoning-capable, while Preview is not marked as a thinking model.

### Custom OpenAI-Compatible Gateways

For a single third-party service that implements the OpenAI Chat Completions
API, the simplest setup is the built-in `openai` provider name pointed at the
gateway:

```toml
provider = "openai"
default_text_model = "your-model-id"

[providers.openai]
api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://your-gateway.example/v1"
```

Put the endpoint under `[providers.openai]`, not the legacy top-level
`base_url`, so the OpenAI-compatible provider receives it. `default_text_model`
is the model ID sent to the gateway; `[providers.openai].model` can be used as
the OpenAI-provider-specific override.

If you keep several OpenAI-compatible gateways, or need a stable name for an
AgentProfile provider pin, define a user-named custom provider table:

```toml
provider = "lm-studio"

[providers.lm-studio]
kind = "openai-compatible"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1"
api_key = "lm-studio"
model = "qwen-2.5-7b"
```

Custom provider names may be selected with `provider = "<name>"`,
`--provider <name>`, or an AgentProfile `provider = "<name>"` when the matching
`[providers.<name>]` table exists.

StepFun has a first-class provider entry, so keep Coding Plan credentials and
base URL scoped to `[providers.stepfun]`:

```toml
provider = "stepfun"

[providers.stepfun]
api_key = "YOUR_STEPFUN_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.stepfun.ai/step_plan/v1"
model = "step-3.7-flash"
```

Alibaba Bailian / Model Studio DashScope Qwen routes use the same OpenAI
provider shape:

```toml
provider = "openai"

[providers.openai]
api_key = "YOUR_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY"
base_url = "https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1"
model = "qwen-plus"
context_window = 1000000
```

Use the regional DashScope `compatible-mode/v1` base URL that matches the
region of your API key. Codewhale keeps `qwen-plus` scoped to the `openai`
provider route and does not infer a different provider from the model prefix.
The same rule applies to all provider-prefixed model strings: a prefix such as
`deepseek-ai/...` or `deepseek/...` is a provider-owned wire ID under the
selected provider, not an automatic switch to the DeepSeek provider.
Set `context_window` to the gateway/model's real total context window when it
differs from Codewhale's static model metadata.

If the gateway accepts `POST /chat/completions` but rejects
`/v1/chat/completions`, set a provider-local `path_suffix`:

```toml
[providers.openai]
base_url = "https://your-gateway.example/v1"
path_suffix = "/chat/completions"
```

The suffix applies only to chat-completion requests. Model listing and
DeepSeek beta paths keep their built-in routing so a generic gateway override
does not accidentally rewrite `/models` or `/beta/completions`.

For private gateways with broken or intercepted certificates, use
`SSL_CERT_FILE` with a trusted CA bundle. The legacy provider-table key
`insecure_skip_tls_verify = true` is still parsed so `codewhale doctor` can
report stale configs, but provider clients reject it instead of disabling TLS
certificate verification.

Local HTTP endpoints such as Ollama, SGLang, and vLLM are allowed by default
when they use localhost or loopback addresses. For a non-local `http://`
gateway, launch with `DEEPSEEK_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1` only on a trusted network:

```bash
DEEPSEEK_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1 codewhale
```

Third-party OpenAI-compatible gateways that need extra request headers can set
`http_headers = { "X-Model-Provider-Id" = "your-model-provider" }` at the top
level or under a provider table such as `[providers.deepseek]`. When configured,
codewhale sends those custom headers on model API requests. The equivalent
environment override is `DEEPSEEK_HTTP_HEADERS`, using comma-separated
`name=value` pairs such as
`X-Model-Provider-Id=your-model-provider,X-Gateway-Route=dev`. `Authorization`
and `Content-Type` are managed by the client and are not overridden by this
setting.

### Vision Model

Codewhale's chat provider and `image_analyze` tool are configured separately.
The main chat path remains the selected text/tool provider; image analysis runs
through `[vision_model]` when the `vision_model` feature is enabled.

Xiaomi's current image-understanding docs include `mimo-v2.5` for image input.
To use MiMo for `image_analyze`, configure the vision model explicitly:

```toml
[features]
vision_model = true

[vision_model]
model = "mimo-v2.5"
api_key = "YOUR_XIAOMI_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1"
```

The example above uses Xiaomi MiMo's pay-as-you-go OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
If you are using a Token Plan key (`tp-...`) for `[vision_model]`, you must set
`base_url` explicitly because this generic OpenAI-compatible block does not
auto-select MiMo endpoints. Use
`https://token-plan-sgp.xiaomimimo.com/v1` for Singapore accounts,
`https://token-plan-cn.xiaomimimo.com/v1` for China-region accounts, or
`https://token-plan-ams.xiaomimimo.com/v1` for Europe/Amsterdam accounts.

### Auto Model Routing (`[auto.router]`)

With `model = "auto"`, Codewhale routes each turn between a strong and a cheap
model. The routing decision comes from a small classifier call, or from a local
heuristic when no classifier route is available.

By default the classifier is `deepseek-v4-flash` via DeepSeek, used only when a
DeepSeek key is configured; every other setup falls back to the local heuristic
with no classifier call. Point the classifier at any configured provider with
`[auto.router]`:

```toml
[auto.router]
provider = "zai"
model = "glm-5-turbo"
thinking = "off"        # optional; defaults to off
```

When `[auto.router]` is unset, the DeepSeek-flash default applies; when the
configured route has no credentials, Auto mode falls back to the heuristic
instead of failing. The turn's route receipt (`/status` → Auto) records
whether the classifier or the heuristic decided.

To bootstrap MCP and skills directories at their resolved paths, run `codewhale-tui setup`.
To only scaffold MCP, run `codewhale-tui mcp init`.

Note: setup, doctor, mcp, features, sessions, resume/fork, exec, review, and eval
are subcommands of the `codewhale-tui` binary. The `codewhale` dispatcher exposes a
distinct set of commands (`auth`, `config`, `model`, `thread`, `sandbox`,
`app-server`, `mcp-server`, `completion`) and forwards plain prompts to
`codewhale-tui`.

### Startup Update Checks

By default, the TUI starts a background check for the latest stable Codewhale
release and shows a short toast only when a newer release is available and the
official release assets are complete.

Disable the startup check entirely for air-gapped, corporate-proxy, or managed
desktop environments:

```toml
[update]
check_for_updates = false
```

To redirect the startup check, set `update_uri` to an internal endpoint that
returns GitHub-compatible latest-release JSON. Minimal mirror metadata with a
`tag_name` field is accepted; if `assets` are present, Codewhale requires the
same uploaded asset set as the official release before showing the toast.

```toml
[update]
check_for_updates = true
update_uri = "https://internal.mirror.example/codewhale/releases/latest"
```

When `update_uri` is not set, startup checks honor release mirror environment
variables such as `CODEWHALE_RELEASE_BASE_URL` before falling back to the
official GitHub API endpoint. If a configured `update_uri` cannot be fetched or
parsed and a release mirror env var is set, the TUI falls back to that mirror
instead of failing startup.

## Profiles

You can define multiple profiles in the same file:

```toml
api_key = "PERSONAL_KEY"
default_text_model = "deepseek-v4-pro"

[profiles.work]
api_key = "WORK_KEY"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/beta"

```

Select a profile with:

- CLI: `codewhale --profile work`
- Env: `DEEPSEEK_PROFILE=work`

If a profile is selected but missing, codewhale exits with an error listing available profiles.

## Harness Profiles

v0.9 adds a config data model for model-specific harness posture. This is a
preview schema: it can be parsed and tested, but runtime provider/model
selection and prompt/tool behavior are wired in later v0.9 slices.
When no configured profile matches, the resolver falls back to built-in seed
profiles for the model families listed in the cutline doc. Configured profiles
always take precedence over those seeds.

```toml
[[harness_profiles]]
provider_route = "deepseek"
model_pattern = "deepseek-v4.*"

[harness_profiles.posture]
kind = "cache-heavy"          # standard | cache-heavy | lean | custom
max_subagents = 10            # 0 means runtime default
prefer_codebase_search = false
compaction_strategy = "prefix-cache" # default | prefix-cache | aggressive
tool_surface = "full"              # full | read-only | auto
safety_posture = "standard"        # standard | strict | permissive
```

Unknown posture names or unknown keys inside a harness profile fail config
deserialization instead of silently becoming `custom`. That is intentional:
once runtime wiring consumes these profiles, a typo should be visible.
The v0.9 implementation order and automatic-creator boundary are documented in
[`HARNESS_PROFILE_CUTLINE.md`](rfcs/HARNESS_PROFILE_CUTLINE.md).

## Environment Variables

Most runtime environment variables override config values. API-key variables are
fallbacks after saved config and keyring credentials.

The three user-facing slots — provider, model, base URL — expose `CODEWHALE_*`
aliases. When both forms are set the `CODEWHALE_*` value wins; the
`DEEPSEEK_*` form is kept for older shells:

- `CODEWHALE_PROVIDER` (preferred) / `DEEPSEEK_PROVIDER` (legacy alias) —
  `deepseek|deepseek-anthropic|nvidia-nim|openai|atlascloud|wanjie-ark|volcengine|openrouter|xiaomi-mimo|novita|fireworks|siliconflow|arcee|siliconflow-CN|moonshot|sglang|vllm|ollama|huggingface|together|qianfan|openai-codex|anthropic|openmodel|zai|stepfun|minimax|deepinfra`
- `CODEWHALE_MODEL` (preferred) / `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` (legacy alias) — default model for the active provider
- `CODEWHALE_BASE_URL` (preferred) / `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` (legacy alias) — base URL for the active provider

Remaining variables:

- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- `DEEPSEEK_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- `DEEPSEEK_HTTP_HEADERS` (custom model request headers, comma-separated `name=value` pairs)
- `DEEPSEEK_DEFAULT_TEXT_MODEL` (extra legacy alias of `DEEPSEEK_MODEL`)
- `DEEPSEEK_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (stream idle timeout in seconds; default `900`, clamped to `1..=3600`)
- `DEEPSEEK_STREAM_OPEN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (connection setup + response-header wait in seconds; default `45`, clamped to `5..=300`; distinct from the per-chunk idle timeout)
- `CODEWHALE_CACHE_MAXIMAL` (`1`/`true`/`on`/`yes`) — cache-maximal context mode (#528). When on, the Repo Working Set block materializes the **full current contents** of the top active files into the system prompt each turn (deterministic order, byte-bounded), instead of only listing their paths. The block stays byte-stable while those files are unchanged so DeepSeek's KV prefix cache keeps hitting; editing a file cache-misses from its block onward. Off by default (path list only). Byte caps default to 24 KB per file / 96 KB total.
- `NVIDIA_API_KEY` or `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY` (preferred when provider is `nvidia-nim`; falls back to `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`)
- `NVIDIA_NIM_BASE_URL`, `NIM_BASE_URL`, or `NVIDIA_BASE_URL`
- `NVIDIA_NIM_MODEL`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

- `OPENROUTER_MODEL`
- `XIAOMI_MIMO_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY`, `MIMO_TOKEN_PLAN_API_KEY`, `XIAOMI_MIMO_API_KEY`, `XIAOMI_API_KEY`, or `MIMO_API_KEY`
- `XIAOMI_MIMO_BASE_URL` or `MIMO_BASE_URL`
- `XIAOMI_MIMO_MODEL` or `MIMO_MODEL`
- `XIAOMI_MIMO_MODE` or `MIMO_MODE` (`token-plan-sgp`, `token-plan-cn`,
  `token-plan-ams`, or `pay-as-you-go`)
- `NOVITA_API_KEY`
- `NOVITA_BASE_URL`
- `NOVITA_MODEL`
- `FIREWORKS_API_KEY`
- `FIREWORKS_BASE_URL`
- `FIREWORKS_MODEL`

- `QIANFAN_BASE_URL` or `BAIDU_QIANFAN_BASE_URL`
- `QIANFAN_MODEL` or `BAIDU_QIANFAN_MODEL`
- `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_CODEX_BASE_URL` or `CODEX_BASE_URL`

- `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` or `KIMI_API_KEY`
- `MOONSHOT_BASE_URL` or `KIMI_BASE_URL`
- `MOONSHOT_MODEL`, `KIMI_MODEL_NAME`, or `KIMI_MODEL`
- `SGLANG_BASE_URL`

- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
- `OLLAMA_MODEL`
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (optional; many localhost Ollama servers do not require auth)
For every product-level `CODEWHALE_*` variable below, the matching legacy
`DEEPSEEK_*` name is still read as a compatibility fallback; when both are set,
the `CODEWHALE_*` value wins.

- `CODEWHALE_LOG_LEVEL` or `RUST_LOG` (`info`/`debug`/`trace` enables lightweight verbose logs)
- `CODEWHALE_SKILLS_DIR`
- `CODEWHALE_MCP_CONFIG`
- `CODEWHALE_NOTES_PATH`
- `CODEWHALE_MEMORY` (`1|on|true|yes|y|enabled` turns user memory on)
- `CODEWHALE_MEMORY_PATH`
- `CODEWHALE_ALLOW_SHELL` (`1`/`true` enables)
- `CODEWHALE_APPROVAL_POLICY` (`on-request|untrusted|never`)
- `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_MODE` (`read-only|workspace-write|danger-full-access|external-sandbox`)
- `CODEWHALE_MANAGED_CONFIG_PATH`
- `CODEWHALE_REQUIREMENTS_PATH`
- `CODEWHALE_MAX_SUBAGENTS` (clamped to `1..=20`)
- `CODEWHALE_TASKS_DIR` (runtime task queue/artifact storage, default
  `~/.codewhale/tasks`, with legacy `~/.deepseek/tasks` fallback when only the
  legacy directory exists)
- `CODEWHALE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` (`1`/`true` allows non-local `http://` base URLs; default is reject)
- `CODEWHALE_FORCE_HTTP1` (`1|true|yes|on` pins the HTTP client to HTTP/1.1, disabling HTTP/2; useful on Windows or behind proxies that mishandle long-lived H2 streams)
- `CODEWHALE_HOME` (override the base data directory; defaults to `~/.codewhale`).
  If you previously exported `DEEPSEEK_HOME`, rename it to `CODEWHALE_HOME`;
  the old env var is not used for new Codewhale state paths.
- `CODEWHALE_RELEASE_BASE_URL` (release asset mirror used by `codewhale update`
  and by TUI startup update checks when `[update].update_uri` is not set, or as
  a fallback when that configured URI cannot be fetched)
- `CODEWHALE_AUTOMATIONS_DIR` (override the automations storage directory; uses
  `~/.codewhale/automations` by default, with legacy `~/.deepseek/automations`
  fallback when only the legacy directory exists)
- `NO_ANIMATIONS` (`1|true|yes|on` forces `low_motion = true` and
  `fancy_animations = false` at startup, regardless of the saved
  settings; see [`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`](./ACCESSIBILITY.md)).
- `SSL_CERT_FILE` — corporate-proxy / TLS-inspecting MITM users
  point this at a PEM bundle (or single DER cert) and the cert(s)
  get added alongside the platform's system trust store. Failures
  log a warning and continue — the existing system roots still
  apply.

### Instruction sources (`instructions = [...]`, #454)

Add a list of additional system-prompt sources that get
concatenated, in declared order, alongside the auto-loaded
`AGENTS.md`:

```toml
instructions = [
    "./AGENTS.md",
    "~/.codewhale/global.md",
    "~/team/agents-shared.md",
]
```

Rules:

- Paths run through `expand_path` so `~` and env vars work.
- Each file is capped at 100 KiB; oversized files are
  truncated with a `[…elided]` marker rather than skipped.
- Missing files are skipped with a tracing warning so a stale
  entry doesn't fail the launch.
- Only user-owned config, profiles, and managed config may set this array.
  Project config (`<workspace>/.codewhale/config.toml`, or legacy
  `<workspace>/.deepseek/config.toml`) ignores `instructions` so a cloned repo
  cannot choose arbitrary local files to place into the prompt.

### `/hooks` listing

Run `/hooks` (or `/hooks list`) inside the TUI to see every
configured lifecycle hook grouped by event, including each
hook's name, command preview, timeout, and condition. The
`[hooks].enabled` flag's state is shown at the top so it's
obvious when hooks are globally suppressed. Hooks are
configured under `[[hooks.hooks]]` entries — see the existing
hook-system documentation for the full schema.

### Mutable `message_submit` hooks

`message_submit` hooks run before a submitted message is added to
history or sent to the model. Unlike observer-only lifecycle hooks,
non-background `message_submit` hooks can replace or block the
submitted text.

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "message_submit"
command = "~/.codewhale/hooks/inject-context.sh"
timeout_secs = 2
continue_on_error = true
```

The hook receives JSON on stdin:

```json
{
  "event": "message_submit",
  "text": "original user text",
  "session_id": "sess_12345678",
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
  "mode": "agent",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "total_tokens": 1234
}
```

If the hook exits `0` and prints JSON with a non-empty string `text` field,
that value replaces the submitted text:

```json
{ "text": "replacement user text" }
```

Exit `0` with empty stdout, or stdout JSON without `text`, leaves
the current text unchanged. A JSON `text` field must not be empty;
`{"text":""}` is treated as invalid stdout and ignored. Exit `2`
blocks the submission before the turn starts; a `reason` field,
stderr, or stdout can provide the status message shown in the TUI.
Other non-zero exits follow the hook's `continue_on_error` setting.
Timeouts and spawn failures are also surfaced as transient TUI status
messages when `continue_on_error = true` lets submission continue.

Multiple `message_submit` hooks run in config order, and each hook
receives the text produced by the previous hook. Hooks marked
`background = true` are observer-only and cannot transform or block
the message. Existing environment variables remain available.
`shell_env` hooks keep their existing `KEY=VALUE` stdout contract;
JSON stdout contracts exist for `message_submit` (above) and
`tool_call_before` (below).

### `tool_call_before` decision hooks

`tool_call_before` hooks run before each tool call executes. In
addition to the legacy hard deny (exit code `2`, which always wins
regardless of stdout), a foreground hook may print a JSON decision on
stdout with exit code `0`:

```json
{
  "decision": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
  "reason": "human-readable explanation (used for deny)",
  "updatedInput": { "command": "ls -la" },
  "additionalContext": "text appended to the tool result for the model"
}
```

All fields are optional. Empty stdout, non-JSON stdout, and JSON
without a `decision` field behave exactly as before (allow). An
unrecognized `decision` string logs a warning and is treated as allow.

- `deny` blocks the tool; the model receives a permission-denied tool
  result containing `reason`.
- `ask` forces the interactive approval prompt in Ask and Auto-Review even for
  tools that would otherwise auto-run. Full Access does not open tool-approval
  prompts, so hook `ask` does not downgrade that posture.
- `updatedInput` must be a JSON object; it replaces the tool input
  before execution. When several hooks supply it, the last hook wins.
- `additionalContext` is appended to the tool result sent back to the
  model as `[hook context] ...`. Multiple hooks' contexts are
  concatenated.

When multiple hooks match, precedence is deny > ask > allow. Hooks
marked `background = true` cannot steer tool calls — they exit
immediately without a captured result.

Example deny hook:

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "tool_call_before"
command = '''echo '{"decision":"deny","reason":"blocked by project policy"}' '''
condition = { type = "tool_name", name = "exec_shell" }
```

Example ask hook (force approval for every MCP tool):

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "tool_call_before"
command = '''echo '{"decision":"ask"}' '''
condition = { type = "tool_name", name = "mcp__*" }
```

Example input rewrite:

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "tool_call_before"
command = "~/.codewhale/hooks/clamp-shell-timeout.sh"
condition = { type = "tool_name", name = "exec_shell" }
```

where the script reads the hook context, then prints
`{"updatedInput": {...}}` with the adjusted arguments.

`tool_name` conditions support `*` globs: `mcp__*` matches every MCP
tool (e.g. `mcp__github__create_issue`) but not built-ins like
`read_file`; exact names keep matching exactly. Other regex
metacharacters in the pattern are matched literally.

### Project-local hooks

Repositories can ship policy in `<workspace>/.codewhale/hooks.toml`,
using the same shape as the `[hooks]` table (top-level fields plus
`[[hooks]]` entries). Project hooks are executable shell
configuration, so Codewhale only loads them after the workspace has
been trusted in user-owned config through the trust prompt or a
`[projects."<workspace>"] trust_level = "trusted"` entry. Session
`/trust on` mode does not enable repo-supplied hooks by itself, and
repo-local legacy markers such as `.deepseek/trusted` do not enable
project hooks. Once trusted, project hooks are appended after global
hooks from `config.toml`, so they run last and, for `updatedInput`,
win ties. A malformed trusted project file logs a warning and startup
falls back to global hooks only.

```toml
# .codewhale/hooks.toml
[[hooks]]
event = "tool_call_before"
command = '''echo '{"decision":"deny","reason":"no shell in this repo"}' '''
condition = { type = "tool_name", name = "exec_shell" }
```

### Turn-end observer hooks

`turn_end` hooks observe the end of each model turn after post-turn
state, usage totals, cost accounting, notifications, receipts, and
queue recovery have been updated. They receive JSON on stdin and are
observer-only: stdout is ignored, failures are logged as warnings, and
the hook cannot block user input, mutate the transcript, or change the
next queued follow-up.

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "turn_end"
command = "~/.codewhale/hooks/turn-audit.sh"
timeout_secs = 2
continue_on_error = true
```

The payload includes common hook metadata plus post-turn accounting:

```json
{
  "event": "turn_end",
  "session_id": "sess_12345678",
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
  "mode": "agent",
  "created_at": "2026-07-12T10:30:00+00:00",
  "model_backed": true,
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "billing_surface": null,
  "turn_id": "turn_12345678",
  "status": "completed",
  "error": null,
  "duration_ms": 1834,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 1200,
    "output_tokens": 180,
    "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 900,
    "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 300,
    "reasoning_tokens": null,
    "reasoning_replay_tokens": null
  },
  "totals": {
    "session_tokens": 1380,
    "conversation_tokens": 1380,
    "input_tokens": 1200,
    "output_tokens": 180
  },
  "tool_count": 2,
  "queued_message_count": 1,
  "stop_hook_active": false
}
```

`created_at` anchors time-window pricing; `provider` and `model` identify the
effective route used for model-backed turns. `billing_surface` is an optional,
non-secret classification derived from the endpoint that actually served the
turn. Recognized StepFun routes emit `stepfun-payg` or `stepfun-plan`; the raw
base URL is never written to hook or runtime records. Runtime `TurnRecord`
exports call the same field `effective_billing_surface`, which `scorecard`
accepts as an alias. This keeps subscription quota separate from token-priced
usage. Unrecognized and custom endpoints remain `null` and unpriced.

Shell-only lifecycle completions set `model_backed` to `false` and may report a
`null` provider; offline scorecards exclude those records from model token and
cost totals. Completion-only shell, manual-compaction, and purge events that do
not have a matching `TurnStarted` retain the observer notification with a
synthetic `lifecycle_<uuid>` turn id and the time the completion was observed.

For `interrupted` or `failed` turns, `status` reflects that terminal
state and `error` carries the engine error string when one is available.
`stop_hook_active` is reserved for future re-entry protection and is
currently always `false`.

### Sub-agent lifecycle hooks

`subagent_spawn` and `subagent_complete` hooks observe sub-agent lifecycle
events. They receive bounded JSON metadata on stdin and are observer-only:
hook failures are logged as warnings and do not block sub-agent scheduling,
change prompts, or change results. For these observer events,
`continue_on_error` has no effect: later matching hooks still run even when an
earlier hook exits non-zero.

```toml
[[hooks.hooks]]
event = "subagent_complete"
command = "~/.codewhale/hooks/subagent-audit.sh"
timeout_secs = 2
continue_on_error = true
```

`subagent_spawn` receives:

```json
{
  "event": "subagent_spawn",
  "agent_id": "agent_12345678",
  "session_id": "sess_12345678",
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
  "mode": "agent",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "total_tokens": 1234,
  "prompt_preview": "bounded prompt preview",
  "prompt_truncated": false
}
```

`subagent_complete` receives the same common fields plus terminal metadata:

```json
{
  "event": "subagent_complete",
  "agent_id": "agent_12345678",
  "session_id": "sess_12345678",
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
  "mode": "agent",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "total_tokens": 1234,
  "status": "completed",
  "result_preview": "bounded result preview",
  "result_truncated": false
}
```

Previews are capped before delivery so lifecycle hooks do not receive full
sub-agent prompts, transcripts, or unbounded results. Use the transcript handle
returned by `agent` when full sub-agent details are needed.

### Composer stash (`/stash`, Ctrl+G / Ctrl+S)

Press **Ctrl+G** in the composer to park the current draft to
`~/.codewhale/composer_stash.jsonl`. `/stash list` shows parked
drafts with one-line previews and timestamps; `/stash pop`
restores the most recently parked draft (LIFO); `/stash clear`
wipes the file. Capped at 200 entries; multiline drafts
round-trip intact. When a turn is already running and queued follow-ups exist,
the pending-input preview advertises **Ctrl+G send now**; in that state Ctrl+G
sends the next queued follow-up into the active turn instead of stashing.
**Ctrl+S** remains an alias in terminals that forward it; Cursor and VS Code
reserve Ctrl+S for Save, so Ctrl+G is the portable default.

## Settings File (Persistent UI Preferences)

codewhale also stores user preferences in:

- `~/.codewhale/settings.toml` on new installs
- `~/.deepseek/settings.toml` or the legacy platform config-dir
  `deepseek/settings.toml` when an existing settings file is present

Notable settings include `auto_compact`, which uses a model-aware default-on
policy for known context windows up to the 1M-token V4 class. Automatic
compaction runs before the active model limit and carries the compacted summary
forward into the next request. The trigger defaults to
`auto_compact_threshold_percent = 80`. Users who prefer manual continuity can
persist `auto_compact = false`; manual `/compact` / Ctrl+L remains available.
You can inspect or update these from the TUI with `/settings` and `/config`
(interactive editor).

Common settings keys:

- `theme` (`system`, `terminal`, `dark`, `light`, `grayscale`,
  `catppuccin-mocha`, `tokyo-night`, `dracula`, `gruvbox-dark`, `claude`,
  `matrix`, `solarized-light`; default `system`): `system` follows terminal
  background detection, `dark`/`light` use the Codewhale Whale pair,
  `terminal` inherits the host terminal, `grayscale` is the low-opinion
  black/white theme, and the named community presets apply across the TUI.
  Aliases such as `whale`, `mono`, `black-white`, `tokyonight`, and `gruvbox`
  are accepted. In Whale, cobalt blue owns action/focus, seafoam owns live
  work, Signal Gold owns human decisions and the whale, coral owns warnings,
  rose owns danger, violet owns Operate, and green remains completed/verified.
  Text labels, markers, and motion policy carry the same states when color is
  unavailable; color is never the only cue.
- `auto_compact` (on/off, model-aware default on for known context windows
  unless explicitly configured)
- `auto_compact_threshold_percent` (10-100, default `80`): pre-send
  auto-compaction threshold used only when `auto_compact` is enabled.
- `paste_burst_detection` (on/off, default on): fallback rapid-key paste
  detection for terminals that do not emit bracketed-paste events. This is
  independent of terminal bracketed-paste mode.
- `work_surface_placement` (`top`, `left`, or `right`; default `top`): places
  Ocean's Tasks / To-do / Workers surface above the transcript or in a side
  rail. Side choices fall back to the top layout on narrow terminals and in
  Classic without changing the saved Ocean preference. Set it live with
  `/config work_surface_placement right --save` (or `left` / `top`).
- `mention_menu_limit` (integer, default `128`): maximum number of
  `@`-mention popup candidates retained before the composer renders the
  visible window. The visible rows still depend on terminal height.
- `mention_walk_depth` (integer, default `6`): maximum workspace depth for
  `@`-mention completion walks. Set to `0` for unlimited depth in deeply
  nested workspaces; keep the default in very large repos unless needed.
- `mention_menu_behavior` (`fuzzy`, `browser`; default `fuzzy`): controls how
  `@`-mention completions are populated. `fuzzy` searches the workspace and
  applies mention frecency. `browser` lists only the immediate children of the
  currently typed directory segment in deterministic alphabetical order.
- `show_thinking` (on/off)
- `show_tool_details` (on/off)
- `locale` (`auto`, `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `pt-BR`; default `auto`): UI chrome
  locale. `auto` checks `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, then `LANG`; unsupported or
  missing locales fall back to English. The runtime also exposes the resolved
  locale in the system prompt as the fallback natural language for V4 reasoning
  and replies when the latest user message is ambiguous. Clear user language
  still takes priority; Chinese turns should produce Chinese `reasoning_content`
  and Chinese final replies even when the resolved locale is English.
- `background_color` (`#RRGGBB`, `RRGGBB`, or `default`): optional main TUI
  background color applied to the root, header, transcript, and footer
  surfaces while preserving panel contrast.
- `cost_currency` (`usd`, `cny`; default `usd`): currency used by the footer,
  context panel, `/cost`, `/tokens`, and long-turn notification summaries. The
  aliases `rmb` and `yuan` normalize to `cny`.
- `default_mode` (`agent`, `plan`, or `operate`; legacy values are accepted for migration but are not live mode vocabulary)
- `launch_screen` (`on`/`off`; default `off`): show the pre-session New/
  Resume/Worktree menu. With it off, Codewhale enters a new session directly;
  resume remains available in-session.
- `sidebar_focus` (`pinned`, `auto`, `tasks`, `agents`, `context`, `hidden`; default
  `pinned`): selects the right sidebar focus. `pinned` keeps the right sidebar
  visible when the terminal is wide enough and composes Work, Tasks, Agents,
  and optional Context as they have live content. `auto` uses the same composed
  panels but collapses while idle. Saving
  `/sidebar auto --save` records an explicit auto-collapse opt-in so upgraded
  settings files that only captured the old default can migrate back to `pinned`.
  `hidden` disables the right sidebar entirely so raw terminal selection cannot
  cross from the transcript into sidebar borders. Legacy `plan` and `todos`
  values, plus the old `work` name, are accepted and normalized to `pinned`.
- `max_history` (number of submitted input history entries; cleared drafts are
  also kept locally for composer history search)
- `default_model` (model name override)

Plan and Act are the everyday visible modes in the UI; Operate is an explicit
preview entry while its Workflow control surface is still being built. Switch
between them with `/mode`. For compatibility, older settings files with
`default_mode = "normal"` still load as `agent`.

Localization scope is tracked in [LOCALIZATION.md](LOCALIZATION.md). The v0.7.6
core pack covers high-visibility TUI chrome only; provider/tool schemas,
personality prompts, and full documentation remain English unless explicitly
translated later.

Readability semantics:

- Selection uses a unified style across transcript, composer menus, and modals.
- Footer hints use a dedicated semantic role (`FOOTER_HINT`) so hint text stays readable across themes.

### Token Quantities and Drivers

DeepSeek V4 prefix caching makes token labels matter. These quantities are kept
separate:

| Quantity | Meaning | Allowed to drive |
|---|---|---|
| Active request input estimate | Conservative estimate of the next request's live system prompt and transcript payload. | Header/footer context percent, auto-compaction trigger, opt-in Flash seam trigger, and emergency overflow preflight. |
| Reserved response headroom | The internal turn budget plus safety headroom. v0.8.16 keeps normal turns at `262144` reserved output tokens and adds `1024` safety tokens for context-window checks, even though V4 capability metadata reports the official `384000` max output. | Emergency overflow budget checks only. |
| Cumulative API usage | Provider-reported input plus output tokens summed across completed API calls; multi-tool turns may count the same stable prefix more than once. | Session usage and approximate cost telemetry only. |
| Prompt cache hit/miss | Provider cache telemetry for the most recent call when available. | Cache-hit display and cost estimation only; never compaction or seam triggers. |
| Context percent | Active request input estimate divided by the model context window. | Display only; it mirrors the active-input basis used by context safeguards. |
| Cost estimate | Approximate spend from provider usage and configured DeepSeek rates. | Display only. |

For known context-window models, including 1M-class V4 models, replacement
compaction is enabled by default unless the user explicitly configures
`auto_compact = false`. It fires at the active model's compaction threshold and
replays the generated summary through the stable system prompt on the next
request. Unknown model ids remain opt-in. The Flash seam manager remains opt-in
(`[context].enabled = false`), and the capacity controller remains disabled
unless configured.

### Command Migration Notes

If you are upgrading from older releases:

- Old: `/codewhale`
  New: `/links` (aliases: `/dashboard`, `/api`)
- Old: `/set model deepseek-reasoner`
  New: `/config` and edit the `model` row to `deepseek-v4-pro` or `deepseek-v4-flash`
- Old: visible `Normal` mode or `default_mode = "normal"`
  New: use `Agent` / `default_mode = "agent"`; legacy `normal` still maps to `agent`
- Old: discover `/set` in slash UX/help
  New: use `/config` for editing and `/settings` for read-only inspection

## Key Reference

### Core keys (used by the TUI/engine)

- `provider` (string, optional): `deepseek` (default), `deepseek-anthropic`, `nvidia-nim`, `openai`, `atlascloud`, `wanjie-ark`, `volcengine`, `openrouter`, `xiaomi-mimo`, `novita`, `fireworks`, `siliconflow`, `arcee`, `siliconflow-CN`, `moonshot`, `sglang`, `vllm`, `ollama`, `huggingface`, `together`, `qianfan`, `openai-codex`, `anthropic`, `openmodel`, `zai`, `stepfun`, `minimax`, `deepinfra`, `sakana`, `longcat`, `opencode-go`, `meta`, or `xai`. Legacy `deepseek-cn` configs are still accepted as an alias for `deepseek`; DeepSeek uses the same official host [`https://api.deepseek.com`](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) worldwide. `deepseek-anthropic` targets DeepSeek's Anthropic Messages-compatible endpoint at `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic` using `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; `nvidia-nim` targets NVIDIA's NIM-hosted DeepSeek endpoints through `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`; `openai` targets a generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint, defaulting to `https://api.openai.com/v1`; `atlascloud` targets AtlasCloud's OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1`; `wanjie-ark` targets Wanjie Ark's OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://maas-openapi.wanjiedata.com/api/v1`; `volcengine` targets Volcengine Ark's OpenAI-compatible coding endpoint at `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/coding/v3`; `openrouter` targets `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`; `xiaomi-mimo` targets Xiaomi MiMo's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, using `https://token-plan-sgp.xiaomimimo.com/v1` by default for Token Plan keys (`tp-...`) and `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` for pay-as-you-go keys. For Token Plan accounts outside the Singapore default, set `base_url` explicitly or use `mode = "token-plan-cn"` for China and `mode = "token-plan-ams"` for Europe/Amsterdam; `novita` targets `https://api.novita.ai/openai/v1`; `fireworks` targets `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1`; `siliconflow` targets SiliconFlow, defaulting to `https://api.siliconflow.com/v1`; `arcee` targets Arcee AI's OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://api.arcee.ai/api/v1`; `siliconflow-CN` targets the SiliconFlow China regional endpoint through `[providers.siliconflow_cn]`; `moonshot` targets Moonshot/Kimi, defaulting to `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`; `sglang` targets a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint, defaulting to `http://localhost:30000/v1`; `vllm` targets a self-hosted vLLM OpenAI-compatible endpoint, defaulting to `http://localhost:8000/v1`; `ollama` targets Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, defaulting to `http://localhost:11434/v1`; `huggingface` targets Hugging Face Inference Providers at `https://router.huggingface.co/v1`; `together` targets Together AI at `https://api.together.xyz/v1`; `qianfan` targets Baidu Qianfan at `https://api.baiduqianfan.ai/v1`; `openai-codex` targets ChatGPT/Codex OAuth; `anthropic` targets Claude's native Messages API; `openmodel` targets OpenModel's Anthropic-compatible Messages API at `https://api.openmodel.ai`; `zai` targets Z.ai at `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`; `stepfun` targets StepFun at `https://api.stepfun.ai/v1`; `minimax` targets MiniMax at `https://api.minimax.io/v1`; `deepinfra` targets DeepInfra at `https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai`; `sakana` targets Sakana AI Fugu at `https://api.sakana.ai/v1`; `longcat` targets Meituan LongCat at `https://api.longcat.chat/openai/v1`; `opencode-go` targets the subscription-backed OpenCode Go Chat Completions route at `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`; `meta` targets Meta Model API; and `xai` targets xAI's API-key or OAuth route.
- `minimax-anthropic` (string provider value): selects MiniMax's Anthropic-compatible Messages route through `[providers.minimax_anthropic]`. The default Base URL is `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic`; set `https://api.minimaxi.com/anthropic` for China. Keep the `/anthropic` suffix because Codewhale appends `/v1/messages`. The route uses `MINIMAX_API_KEY` and defaults to `MiniMax-M3`; `MiniMax-M2.7` is also registered. Official M3 input modalities are text, image, and video, with adaptive or disabled thinking. M2.7 is text-only and always keeps thinking enabled.
- `api_key` (string, required for hosted providers): must be non-empty for DeepSeek/hosted providers (or set the provider API key env var). Self-hosted SGLang, vLLM, and Ollama can omit it.
- `auth_mode` (string, optional provider-table key): selects a provider-specific authentication contract. Kimi Code membership uses `auth_mode = "api_key"` (or omit the field), a key created in the [Kimi Code console](https://www.kimi.com/code/console), `base_url = "https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1"`, and bare `model = "k3"` for K3. Codewhale gives that route a safe 262,144-token baseline; set `context_window = 1048576` only when the Kimi Code plan includes 1M access (Allegretto and above). `k3[1m]` is a Claude Code-only convention, not an API model ID, and Codewhale rejects it instead of silently changing the wire model or assuming an entitlement. `model = "kimi-for-coding"` remains the valid K2.7 compatibility route available to all Kimi Code members. Legacy `auth_mode = "kimi_oauth"` fails closed with API-key guidance and never probes, reads, refreshes, or rewrites `kimi_cli`/`kimi_code_cli` credential files. First-class OAuth requires Codewhale's own vendor-registered client identity and remains tracked in #4417.
- `base_url` (string, optional): defaults to `https://api.deepseek.com/beta` for DeepSeek's OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API, including legacy `provider = "deepseek-cn"` configs. Other defaults are `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic` for `deepseek-anthropic`, `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` for `nvidia-nim`, `https://api.openai.com/v1` for `openai`, `https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1` for `atlascloud`, `https://maas-openapi.wanjiedata.com/api/v1` for `wanjie-ark`, `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/coding/v3` for `volcengine`, `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for `openrouter`, `https://token-plan-sgp.xiaomimimo.com/v1` for `xiaomi-mimo` when the API key starts with `tp-...` and `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1` otherwise, `https://api.novita.ai/openai/v1` for `novita`, `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` for `fireworks`, `https://api.siliconflow.com/v1` for `siliconflow`, `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` for `siliconflow-CN`, `https://api.arcee.ai/api/v1` for `arcee`, `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` for `moonshot`, `https://api.minimax.io/v1` for `minimax`, `https://api.openmodel.ai` for `openmodel`, `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` for `zai`, `https://api.stepfun.ai/v1` for `stepfun`, `https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai` for `deepinfra`, `https://api.sakana.ai/v1` for `sakana`, `https://router.huggingface.co/v1` for `huggingface`, `https://api.together.xyz/v1` for `together`, `https://api.baiduqianfan.ai/v1` for `qianfan`, `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api` for `openai-codex`, `https://api.anthropic.com` for `anthropic`, `http://localhost:30000/v1` for `sglang`, `http://localhost:8000/v1` for `vllm`, and `http://localhost:11434/v1` for `ollama`. Set `base_url = "https://token-plan-cn.xiaomimimo.com/v1"` for China-region Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan accounts or `base_url = "https://token-plan-ams.xiaomimimo.com/v1"` for Europe/Amsterdam accounts. Set `https://api.deepseek.com` or `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` explicitly to opt out of DeepSeek beta features.
- `context_window` (integer, optional provider-table key): override the total context window for the active `[providers.<name>]` route when an OpenAI-compatible gateway, hosted model alias, or self-hosted runtime has a different limit than Codewhale's static model table. For example, `[providers.openai] context_window = 1000000` lets an OpenAI-compatible DashScope/Qwen route budget against a 1M-token window instead of the conservative fallback. For Kimi Code K3, keep `model = "k3"` and set `[providers.moonshot] context_window = 1048576` only when the membership plan includes 1M access; otherwise omit it to retain the 262,144-token safe baseline. The value must be greater than 0 and affects prompt context notes, compaction thresholds, context-pressure checks, and request output caps.
- `path_suffix` (string, optional provider-table key): override the chat-completions path for OpenAI-compatible gateways that do not serve `/v1/chat/completions`. For example, `[providers.openai] path_suffix = "/chat/completions"` sends chat requests to the unversioned base URL plus `/chat/completions`; `models` and `beta/*` requests keep their normal routing.
- `reasoning_stream_style` (string, optional provider-table key): override how streaming reasoning is separated from answer text for the active provider route. Use `separate_field` for `reasoning_content` / `reasoning` deltas, `inline_tags` for gateways that stream `<think>...</think>` inside `delta.content`, or `none` to render incoming content exactly as answer text.
- `[providers.<name>.auth]` (table, optional): provider-scoped auth source metadata. `source = "command"` stores a command argv plus optional `timeout_ms`; `source = "secret"` stores a `secret_id`. This slice lets provider readiness, `/provider`, and doctor JSON report the auth source class without exposing command argv output or secret values; executing commands and resolving external secret material is handled by the follow-up resolver work.
- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool, optional provider-table key): legacy compatibility key, disabled by default. When true on the active provider table, provider clients reject the configuration instead of skipping TLS certificate verification. Use `SSL_CERT_FILE` for corporate or private CA bundles; `codewhale doctor` reports stale uses of this setting.
- `default_text_model` (string, optional): defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro` for DeepSeek, `deepseek-anthropic`, and generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints, `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro` for NVIDIA NIM, `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash` for AtlasCloud, `deepseek-reasoner` for Wanjie Ark, `DeepSeek-V4-Pro` for Volcengine Ark, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` for OpenRouter and Novita, `mimo-v2.5-pro` for Xiaomi MiMo, `accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-pro` for Fireworks, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` for SiliconFlow and DeepInfra, `trinity-large-thinking` for Arcee AI, `kimi-k2.7-code` for Moonshot, `MiniMax-M3` for MiniMax, `GLM-5.2` for Z.ai, `step-3.7-flash` for StepFun, `ernie-4.0-turbo-8k` for Qianfan, `fugu` for Sakana AI, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` for SGLang/vLLM, and `deepseek-coder:1.3b` for Ollama. Hugging Face and Together AI both default to `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro`; `openai-codex` defaults to `gpt-5.5`; `anthropic` defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6`; `openmodel` defaults to `deepseek-v4-flash`. Current public DeepSeek IDs are `deepseek-v4-pro` and `deepseek-v4-flash`, both with 1M context windows, 384K max output, and thinking mode enabled by default. DeepSeek retires `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` on July 24, 2026; direct first-party routes migrate both to `deepseek-v4-flash`, with omitted reasoning settings preserving their former non-thinking (`off`) and thinking (`high`) intent. Explicit `reasoning_effort` wins, and provider-owned ids on Wanjie Ark, aggregators, self-hosted runtimes, and custom endpoints are not globally rewritten. SiliconFlow retains its own mapping: `deepseek-reasoner` and `deepseek-r1` select its Pro model while `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-v3` select Flash. Provider-specific mappings translate `deepseek-v4-pro` / `deepseek-v4-flash` to each provider's model ID where supported. OpenRouter also recognizes recent large IDs such as `arcee-ai/trinity-large-thinking`, `minimax/minimax-m3`, `minimax/minimax-m2.7`, `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro`, `qwen/qwen3.6-flash`, `qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`, `qwen/qwen3.6-max-preview`, `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`, `qwen/qwen3.6-plus`, `qwen/qwen3.7-max`, `google/gemma-4-31b-it`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning:free`, and `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b`; direct Arcee uses bare IDs such as `trinity-large-thinking` and `trinity-large-preview`; direct Moonshot recognizes `kimi-k3`, `kimi-k2.7-code`, and `kimi-k2.6`. The exact Kimi Code endpoint recognizes bare `k3` for K3 and `kimi-for-coding` for K2.7; those membership IDs are distinct from the direct Moonshot IDs and are never rewritten across routes. Direct MiniMax recognizes `MiniMax-M3` and the documented M2.x chat model IDs; direct Sakana recognizes `fugu` and `fugu-ultra-20260615`; direct Xiaomi MiMo recognizes chat IDs `mimo-v2.5-pro`, `mimo-v2.5-pro-ultraspeed`, and `mimo-v2.5`, while TTS IDs are selected through `codewhale speech` / `tts`. Generic `openai`, `atlascloud`, `wanjie-ark`, `xiaomi-mimo`, `arcee`, `moonshot`, `minimax`, `openmodel`, `zai`, `stepfun`, `qianfan`, `sakana`, and Ollama model IDs are passed through unchanged after known aliases are normalized. OpenRouter and SiliconFlow provider configs with a custom `base_url` also preserve explicit model values, which lets OpenAI-compatible gateways accept bare model IDs. Use `/models` or `codewhale models` to discover live IDs from your configured endpoint. `CODEWHALE_MODEL` overrides this for a single process; `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` is the legacy alias.
- `reasoning_effort` (string, optional): `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`, `xhigh`, or `ultracode`; defaults to the configured UI tier. DeepSeek Platform receives top-level `thinking` / `reasoning_effort` fields. Direct Moonshot `kimi-k3` on exact `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1` is always-thinking and receives only top-level `reasoning_effort = "low" | "high" | "max"`; `off` normalizes to `low`, and `medium` to `high`. Kimi Code membership `k3` on exact `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` instead receives nested `thinking.effort`, and its `off` setting also normalizes to enabled `low`. Normal dispatched `auto` uses Codewhale's auto-reasoning selector and sends a concrete route-normalized tier; only an omitted reasoning setting leaves the provider default in control. Neighboring gateways and model/endpoint combinations retain the generic Moonshot contract. OpenAI Codex normalizes stale `off` to `low` and sends `max` / `ultracode` as Responses `xhigh`. Z.ai receives documented `thinking` controls and treats enabled thinking as the GLM coding high/max lane. NVIDIA NIM receives equivalent settings through `chat_template_kwargs`.
- `verbosity` (string, optional): `normal` or `concise`. `normal` keeps the
  default conversational prompt. `concise` appends a prompt discipline block
  for direct, low-chatter output; CLI noninteractive commands (`exec` and
  `eval`) default to `concise` unless config/env/CLI overrides it.
  Override per process with `CODEWHALE_VERBOSITY` or the legacy
  `DEEPSEEK_VERBOSITY` alias.
- `allow_shell` (bool, optional): in interactive TUI Agent sessions, omitting
  this keeps shell tools available with approval prompts; setting it to `false`
  hides shell tools. Headless, durable-task, and other noninteractive profiles
  keep the conservative omitted-field default and require `allow_shell = true`
  to expose shell. Plan mode always hides shell; Full Access enables shell and
  auto-approval.
- `approval_policy` (string, optional): `on-request`, `untrusted`, or `never`. Runtime `approval_mode` editing in `/config` also accepts `on-request` and `untrusted` aliases.
- `sandbox_mode` (string, optional): `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`, `external-sandbox`.
  Platform support is not identical. macOS uses Seatbelt for policy
  enforcement. Linux support is helper-gated around Landlock. Windows does not
  currently advertise an OS sandbox; the planned Windows helper contract starts
  with process-tree containment only and must not be described as read-only
  filesystem isolation, workspace-write enforcement, network blocking,
  registry isolation, or AppContainer isolation until those are implemented.
- `permissions.toml` (sibling file, optional): typed permission rule records
  loaded next to `config.toml`, for example `~/.codewhale/permissions.toml`.
  Manually authored `[[rules]]` entries accept `tool`, optional `command` or
  `path`, and optional `action = "deny" | "ask" | "allow"`; omitted `action`
  defaults to `"ask"`. `deny` blocks matching invocations before mode-based
  approval handling, `allow` skips approval for matching invocations, and
  `ask` forces approval only in modes that can prompt. Outside the TUI
  auto-approve path, a matching `ask` rule under `approval_policy = "never"`
  is rejected because no prompt can be shown. In Full Access / auto-approval sessions,
  `ask` rules do not downgrade the session into prompting or blocking; explicit
  `deny` rules still block according to the current execution-policy logic.

  In a supported approval card, press `S` to approve the request once and
  append exact `action = "ask"` rules to this file. Supported saves are
  intentionally narrow:
  `exec_shell` stores the exact approved command string; `write_file` and
  `edit_file` store the exact workspace-relative file path; `apply_patch`
  stores one exact workspace-relative `path` rule per validated touched file
  from apply-patch preflight. Existing exec command matching remains
  arity-aware, and file paths are normalized to the same workspace-relative
  form used by runtime matching.

  `read_file` rules can still be authored manually when you want future reads
  of a specific path to ask, allow, or deny, but the approval UI does not save
  `read_file` rules. The UI is not a policy editor: it does not save
  `allow`/`deny`, edit or delete rules, expand globs, or create broad
  directory/recursive rules.
- `[[hotbar]]` (array of tables, optional): user-owned 1-8 slot bindings for
  the TUI hotbar. Each entry has `slot`, `action`, and optional `label`.
  Omitting `hotbar` uses the built-in default eight slots. Setting
  `hotbar = []` disables all default slots. When one or more `[[hotbar]]`
  tables are present, that list replaces the defaults; missing slots stay
  empty. Invalid slots outside `1..=8` are skipped with a warning, duplicate
  slots use the later entry, and unknown action IDs are kept so the UI can show
  a disabled/unknown cell instead of silently deleting user config. Trusted
  user config, profiles, and managed config replace the whole list; project
  overlays cannot change hotbar bindings. Setup or wizard flows that persist
  hotbar bindings write this same schema to the resolved `~/.codewhale/config.toml`
  path, preserving legacy `~/.deepseek/config.toml` only when that fallback file
  is already the active config.

  ```toml
  [[hotbar]]
  slot = 1
  action = "mode.plan"
  label = "Plan"

  [[hotbar]]
  slot = 2
  action = "session.compact"
  ```
- `[auto_review]` (table, optional): deterministic tool-call review policy.
  This layer sits on top of existing approval modes; it can hold or block a
  tool call, but it is not an auto-push, auto-merge, or hosted review service.
  Block rules are checked first, then the built-in safety floor, then allow
  rules. In Ask and Auto-Review, a safety hold opens approval; in Full Access
  or a non-interactive `never` posture it fails closed as a hard block. The
  safety floor still covers publish-like actions and destructive
  background/headless actions even if an allow rule matches.

  ```toml
  [auto_review]
  natural_language_guidance = "Prefer read-only inspection until the user asks for writes."

  [[auto_review.allow]]
  id = "read-only-inspection"
  action_kind = "read"
  reason = "Read-only inspection is safe to run automatically."

  [[auto_review.block]]
  id = "no-release-publish"
  action_kind = "publish"
  reason = "Release and publish actions require maintainer review."
  ```

  Rule matchers are exact `tool`, `action_kind`, and/or
  `text_contains` against the current user intent. At least one matcher is
  required. `action_kind` accepts `read`, `write`, `shell`, `network`, `git`,
  `mcp_read`, `mcp_action`, `browser`, `secret`, `publish`, `destructive`, or
  `unknown`; invalid names fail config validation instead of becoming broad
  rules. `natural_language_guidance` is recorded on the runtime policy and audit
  event, but deterministic rules and the built-in safety floor are the enforced
  behavior in current builds.

  Auto-review decisions emit `tool.auto_review_decision` audit events when tool
  audit logging is enabled. Future PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks can add
  observer input around this layer, but the configured auto-review policy is
  evaluated before a tool call is allowed to proceed.
- `managed_config_path` (string, optional): managed config file loaded after user/env config.
- `requirements_path` (string, optional): requirements file used to enforce allowed approval/sandbox values.
- `max_subagents` (int, optional): defaults to `20` and is clamped to `1..=20`.
- `subagents.*` (optional): per-role/type model defaults for `agent`.
  Explicit tool `model` values win, then role/type
  overrides, then the parent runtime model. Supported convenience keys are
  `default_model`, `worker_model`, `explorer_model`, `awaiter_model`,
  `review_model`, `custom_model`, `max_concurrent`, `max_admitted`,
  `launch_concurrency`, `token_budget`, `api_timeout_secs`, and
  `heartbeat_timeout_secs`. The `[subagents] max_concurrent` value overrides
  top-level `max_subagents` and is also clamped to `1..=20`. `[subagents]
  max_admitted` (aliases: `max_total`, `admission_limit`) is the bounded total
  of queued plus running sub-agents; it defaults to `200` so high-fanout turns
  can queue and drain while runtime launch pressure remains bounded, and is
  clamped to `max_concurrent..=200`. `[subagents]
  launch_concurrency` sets how many direct children start at once before the
  rest queue for a launch slot; it defaults to the resolved `max_subagents` cap
  and is clamped to `1..=max_subagents` (the deprecated
  `interactive_max_launch` key is accepted as an alias, with the new key
  winning when both are set). `[subagents] token_budget` is an optional
  aggregate token ceiling for each root `agent` run and its descendants; unset
  or `0` preserves unlimited legacy behavior. `[subagents] api_timeout_secs`
  controls the per-step API timeout for sub-agent model calls and is clamped to
  `1..=1800`, with `0` or unset preserving the legacy 120 second default.
  `[subagents] heartbeat_timeout_secs` controls stale running agent cleanup,
  defaults to `300`, and is clamped to `30..=3600` while staying above the
  resolved API timeout. `[subagents.providers.<provider>]` accepts the same
  fanout, depth, budget, and timeout knobs (`enabled`, `max_concurrent`,
  `max_admitted`, `launch_concurrency`, `max_depth`, `token_budget`,
  `api_timeout_secs`, `heartbeat_timeout_secs`) and inherits the global
  `[subagents]` value for any key you omit. Provider keys accept canonical
  names such as `deepseek`, `zai`, `openrouter`, `anthropic`, plus convenience
  aliases such as `glm` for Z.ai and `deepseek_api` for direct DeepSeek:

  ```toml
  [subagents]
  max_concurrent = 20
  launch_concurrency = 20
  max_admitted = 200
  max_depth = 6

  [subagents.providers.deepseek]
  max_concurrent = 20
  launch_concurrency = 20
  max_admitted = 200

  [subagents.providers.glm]
  max_concurrent = 4
  launch_concurrency = 3
  max_admitted = 12
  max_depth = 2

  [subagents.providers.openrouter]
  max_concurrent = 5
  launch_concurrency = 3
  max_admitted = 20
  ```

  `/config subagents status` prints both global values and the active
  provider's resolved profile so rate-limit tuning is visible in the TUI.
  `[subagents.models]` accepts lower-case role or type keys such as `worker`,
  `explorer`, `general`, `explore`, `plan`, and `review`. Values are validated
  against the active provider at spawn time; direct DeepSeek requires DeepSeek
  IDs, while OpenAI-compatible/custom provider routes pass explicit model IDs
  through to that provider. To route a child to a different provider than the
  parent session, save a Fleet/AgentProfile with explicit `provider` and
  `model` fields (including user-named custom providers such as `lm-studio`)
  and call `agent(profile: "...")`; see [SUBAGENTS.md](SUBAGENTS.md).
- `skills_dir` (string, optional): defaults to `~/.codewhale/skills` (each skill is
  a directory containing `SKILL.md`). Workspace-local `.agents/skills` or
  `./skills` are preferred when present; the runtime also discovers global
  agentskills.io-compatible `~/.agents/skills` and the broader Claude-ecosystem
  `~/.claude/skills`. First launch installs versioned bundled skills for common
  workflows including skill creation, delegation, MCP/plugin scaffolding,
  documents, presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, and Feishu/Lark. See
  [CLAUDE_PLUGIN_COMPAT.md](CLAUDE_PLUGIN_COMPAT.md) for the supported boundary
  between portable `SKILL.md` bundles and Claude Code plugin runtimes.
- `[skills].scan_codewhale_only` (bool, default `false`): when `true`, session
  skill discovery ignores cross-tool roots such as `.claude/skills`,
  `.opencode/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, and `~/.agents/skills`. Codewhale still
  scans `<workspace>/.codewhale/skills`, `~/.codewhale/skills`, and any explicit
  `skills_dir` override.
- `[verifier].enabled` (bool, default `false`): enables automatic
  claim-of-done verifier preview once that runtime trigger is active. The
  manual `run_verifiers` tool is still available when this is false.
- `[verifier].verdict_policy` (string, default `"hunt"`): maps verifier
  `pass` / `partial` / `fail` into the goal verdict vocabulary
  `hunted` / `wounded` / `escaped`. `"hunt"` is the only shipped policy today;
  unknown values are rejected so future policies can be added deliberately.
- `mcp_config_path` (string, optional): defaults to `~/.codewhale/mcp.json`, with
  legacy `~/.deepseek/mcp.json` fallback when the Codewhale path is absent.
  It is visible in `/config` and can be changed from the TUI. The new path is
  used immediately by `/mcp`, but rebuilding the model-visible MCP tool pool
  requires restarting the TUI.
- `notes_path` (string, optional): defaults to `~/.codewhale/notes.txt`, with
  legacy `~/.deepseek/notes.txt` fallback when the Codewhale path is absent, and
  is used by the model-visible `note` tool.
- `[memory].enabled` (bool, optional): defaults to `false`. When `true`,
  the TUI loads the user memory file into a `<user_memory>` prompt block,
  enables `# foo` quick-capture in the composer, surfaces the `/memory`
  slash command, and registers the `remember` tool. The same toggle is
  available via `DEEPSEEK_MEMORY=on`.
- `memory_path` (string, optional): defaults to `~/.codewhale/memory.md`, with
  legacy `~/.deepseek/memory.md` fallback when the Codewhale path is absent.
  Used by the user-memory feature when enabled — see
  [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md) for the full feature surface (`# foo`
  composer prefix, `/memory` slash command, `remember` tool, opt-in
  toggle).
- `snapshots.*` (optional): side-git workspace snapshots for file rollback:
  - `[snapshots].enabled` (bool, default `true`)
  - `[snapshots].max_age_days` (int, default `7`)
  - snapshots live under
    `~/.codewhale/snapshots/<project_hash>/<worktree_hash>/.git`, with legacy
    `~/.deepseek/snapshots/...` fallback when only the legacy state exists, and
    never use the workspace's own `.git` directory
- `context.*` (optional): append-only Fin seam manager, currently opt-in.
  Fin is the fast `deepseek-v4-flash` path with thinking off used for
  coordination work such as routing, summaries, and context maintenance.
  Thresholds use the active request input estimate, not lifetime summed API
  usage:
  - `[context].enabled` (bool, default `false`)
  - `[context].verbatim_window_turns` (int, default `16`)
  - `[context].l1_threshold` (int, default `192000`)
  - `[context].l2_threshold` (int, default `384000`)
  - `[context].l3_threshold` (int, default `576000`)
  - `[context].seam_model` (string, default `deepseek-v4-flash`)
- `retry.*` (optional): retry/backoff settings for API requests:
  - `[retry].enabled` (bool, default `true`)
  - `[retry].max_retries` (int, default `3`)
  - `[retry].initial_delay` (float seconds, default `1.0`)
  - `[retry].max_delay` (float seconds, default `60.0`)
  - `[retry].exponential_base` (float, default `2.0`)
- `capacity.*` (optional): runtime context-capacity controller. This is opt-in
  because its active interventions can rewrite the live transcript.
  - `[capacity].enabled` (bool, default `false`)
  - `[capacity].low_risk_max` (float, default `0.50`)
  - `[capacity].medium_risk_max` (float, default `0.62`)
  - `[capacity].severe_min_slack` (float, default `-0.25`)
  - `[capacity].severe_violation_ratio` (float, default `0.40`)
  - `[capacity].refresh_cooldown_turns` (int, default `6`)
  - `[capacity].replan_cooldown_turns` (int, default `5`)
  - `[capacity].max_replay_per_turn` (int, default `1`)
  - `[capacity].min_turns_before_guardrail` (int, default `4`)
  - `[capacity].profile_window` (int, default `8`)
  - `[capacity].deepseek_v3_2_chat_prior` (float, default `3.9`)
  - `[capacity].deepseek_v3_2_reasoner_prior` (float, default `4.1`)
  - `[capacity].deepseek_v4_pro_prior` (float, default `3.5`)
  - `[capacity].deepseek_v4_flash_prior` (float, default `4.2`)
  - `[capacity].fallback_default_prior` (float, default `3.8`)
- `[notifications].method` (string, optional): `auto`, `osc9`, `bel`, or
  `off`. Defaults to `auto`. The TUI fires this on completed (successful)
  turns whose elapsed time meets `threshold_secs`; failed and cancelled
  turns are silent. `auto` resolves to `osc9` for `iTerm.app`, `Ghostty`,
  and `WezTerm` (detected via `$TERM_PROGRAM`). Otherwise the fallback is
  `bel`; on Windows the BEL path is routed through `MessageBeep(MB_OK)`.
- `[notifications].threshold_secs` (int, optional): defaults to `30`.
  Only completed turns whose elapsed time meets or exceeds this fire a
  notification.
- `[notifications].include_summary` (bool, optional): defaults to
  `false`. When `true`, the notification body includes the elapsed
  duration and the turn's cost in the configured display currency.
- `[notifications].completion_sound` (string, optional): `off`, `beep`,
  `bell`, or `file`. Defaults to `beep`. `file` plays the WAV path from
  `[notifications].sound_file` on Windows.
- `[notifications].sound_file` (path, optional): path to a custom WAV file
  used when `completion_sound = "file"`.
- `tui.alternate_screen` (string, optional): `auto`, `always`, or `never`. This is retained for config compatibility, but interactive sessions now always use the TUI-owned alternate screen so host terminal scrollback cannot hijack the viewport.
- `tui.mouse_capture` (bool, optional, default `true` on non-Windows terminals and on Windows Terminal/ConEmu/Cmder when the alternate screen is active; `false` on legacy Windows console and inside JetBrains JediTerm — PyCharm/IDEA/CLion/etc. — where mouse-event escapes leak into the input stream as garbled text, see #878 / #898): enable internal mouse scrolling, transcript selection, right-click context actions, and transcript scrollbar dragging. TUI-owned drag selection copies only transcript text, removes visual wrap-column line breaks from paragraphs, and keeps selection scoped to the transcript pane. Set this to `false` or run with `--no-mouse-capture` for raw terminal selection; set it to `true` or run with `--mouse-capture` to opt in anywhere it's defaulted off. On raw terminal selection, especially on legacy Windows console or when mouse capture is disabled, selection may cross the right sidebar and include visual wraps because the terminal, not the TUI, owns the selection.
- `tui.terminal_probe_timeout_ms` (int, optional, default `500`): startup terminal-mode probe timeout in milliseconds. Values are clamped to `100..=5000`; timeout emits a warning and aborts startup instead of hanging indefinitely.
- `tui.stream_chunk_timeout_secs` (int, optional, default `900`): per-SSE-chunk idle timeout for streamed model responses. Slow local or compatible servers can raise this with `/config stream_chunk_timeout_secs <seconds>`; `0` maps to the default and explicit values must be `1..=3600`. The legacy `DEEPSEEK_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` env var is still honored when this key is omitted.
- `tui.osc8_links` (bool, optional, default on for macOS/Linux, off for Windows): emit OSC 8 escape sequences around URLs in transcript output so supporting terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app 13+, Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, recent gnome-terminal/konsole) can open them with the terminal's link gesture—usually Cmd-click on macOS and Ctrl-click on Linux/Windows. Terminals without OSC 8 support render the plain label and ignore the escape. The escapes are emitted out-of-band (not inside buffer cells), so column corruption is not a concern; set `false` only for terminals that misrender the OSC 8 terminator itself. Windows legacy consoles default off; opt in with `true`.
- `hooks` (optional): lifecycle hooks configuration (see `config.example.toml`).
- `features.*` (optional): feature flag overrides (see below).

### Workspace notes

`/note` manages a simple notes file in the current workspace at
`.deepseek/notes.md`. Existing `/note <text>` usage still appends a note.
The management forms are:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/note <text>` | Append a note (legacy shorthand) |
| `/note add <text>` | Append a note explicitly |
| `/note list` | List notes with temporary 1-based numbers |
| `/note show <n>` | Show the full note at number `n` |
| `/note edit <n> <text>` | Replace note `n` with new text |
| `/note remove <n>` | Delete note `n`; `rm` and `delete` are aliases |
| `/note clear` | Empty the workspace notes file |
| `/note path` | Show the resolved workspace notes path |

The numbers shown by `/note list` are not stored in the file; they are derived
from the current order each time notes are read. This keeps the file format
compatible with the existing `---`-separated notes.

### User memory

User memory is split across one top-level path setting and one opt-in
toggle table:

```toml
memory_path = "~/.codewhale/memory.md"

[memory]
enabled = true
```

Notes:

- `memory_path` stays at the top level beside `notes_path` and
  `skills_dir`; it is not nested under `[memory]`.
- `DEEPSEEK_MEMORY_PATH` overrides the file path from the environment.
- `DEEPSEEK_MEMORY=on` (also `1`, `true`, `yes`, `y`, or `enabled`)
  flips the feature on without editing `config.toml`.
- The feature is inert when disabled: no file is injected, `# foo`
  falls through to normal message submission, and the model does not
  see the `remember` tool.
- See [`MEMORY.md`](MEMORY.md) for examples and the full `/memory`
  command surface.

### Notifications

The TUI can emit a desktop notification (OSC 9 escape or plain BEL) when a turn **completes successfully** and took longer than a threshold, so you can tab away while a long task runs. Failed or cancelled turns are intentionally silent — the notification is a "your task is ready" cue, not a generic ping. Configuration lives under `[notifications]`:

```toml
[notifications]
method          = "auto"  # auto | osc9 | bel | off
threshold_secs  = 30      # only notify when the turn took >= this many seconds
include_summary = false   # include elapsed time + cost in the notification body
completion_sound = "beep" # off | beep | bell | file
sound_file = "E:\\google\\downloads\\notify.wav" # for completion_sound = "file"
```

Method semantics:

- `auto` (default) — picks `osc9` for `iTerm.app`, `Ghostty`, and `WezTerm` (detected via `$TERM_PROGRAM`). Otherwise it falls back to `bel`; on Windows that BEL path is routed through `MessageBeep(MB_OK)`.
- `osc9` — emit `\x1b]9;<msg>\x07`. Inside tmux the sequence is wrapped in DCS passthrough so it reaches the outer terminal.
- `bel` — emit a single `\x07` byte. Use this on Windows only if you actively want the chime back.
- `off` — disable post-turn notifications entirely.

Windows users who run inside a known OSC-9 terminal (e.g. WezTerm on Windows) keep getting OSC-9 notifications. Set `method = "off"` to disable threshold-based desktop notifications entirely.

`completion_sound = "file"` is for Windows users who want a per-application
completion sound without changing the global Windows sound scheme. It plays the
configured WAV `sound_file` asynchronously via the native Windows audio API.

### Parsed but currently unused (reserved for future versions)

These keys are accepted by the config loader but not currently used by the interactive TUI or built-in tools:

- `tools_file`

## Tool Catalog

Codewhale loads a small core native tool catalog by default and leaves less
common native tools discoverable through ToolSearch. To keep specific native
tools loaded on every request, add them to `[tools].always_load`:

```toml
[tools]
always_load = ["git_show", "notify"]
```

## Feature Flags

Feature flags live under the `[features]` table and are merged across profiles.
Defaults are enabled for built-in tooling, so you only need to set entries you
want to force on or off.

```toml
[features]
shell_tool = true
subagents = true
web_search = true # enables canonical web.run plus the compatibility web_search alias
apply_patch = true
mcp = true
exec_policy = true
```

You can also override features for a single run:

- `codewhale-tui --enable web_search`
- `codewhale-tui --disable subagents`

Use `codewhale-tui features list` to inspect known flags and their effective state.
The native `/config` view also includes a read-only **Experimental** section
for experimental feature flags. It shows each flag's effective enabled/disabled
state and whether that state comes from the default or a configured override.
Change feature flags in `[features]` or with `--enable` / `--disable`; the
`/config` section is an audit surface, not a stability promise. Goal and
Workflow preview rows may appear there as reserved entries until those workflows
graduate behind real gated flags.

## Web Search Provider

`web_search` uses DuckDuckGo by default and does not require an API key. The
DuckDuckGo path keeps a Bing fallback when DDG returns a bot challenge or no
parseable results. Bing remains selectable for users who explicitly want it,
and Tavily, Bocha, Metaso, SearXNG, Baidu, Volcengine, or Sofya can be selected
when an API-backed provider is preferred.

Configured API providers are attempted first. Runtime failure or an empty
result visibly degrades through DuckDuckGo and then Bing; the structured search
receipt records every hop. Missing configuration and network-policy denials
fail closed without sending the query to another provider.

For a private/internal search service that serves DuckDuckGo-compatible HTML,
keep `provider = "duckduckgo"` and set `base_url`; Codewhale appends the `q`
query parameter to that endpoint and applies network policy to its host.
Custom endpoints do not fall back to public Bing. `CODEWHALE_SEARCH_BASE_URL`
can override this per process; `DEEPSEEK_SEARCH_BASE_URL` remains accepted as
the legacy alias.

**SearXNG** ([docs](https://docs.searxng.org/dev/search_api.html)) uses the
configured instance's JSON API. Set `provider = "searxng"` and
`base_url = "https://your-searxng.example"`; Codewhale calls
`/search?q=...&format=json`. Codewhale does not use a public SearXNG instance
by default because public instances often disable JSON output or rate-limit API
traffic.

**Metaso** ([metaso.cn](https://metaso.cn)) requires a user-supplied key. Set
`METASO_API_KEY` or `[search] api_key`; Codewhale does not ship a shared key.

**Baidu** uses Baidu AI Search at
`https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2/ai_search/web_search`. Set
`BAIDU_SEARCH_API_KEY` or `[search] api_key`. This is a search-tool backend
only; it does not add a Baidu model provider.

**Sofya** ([sofya.co](https://sofya.co)) returns full extracted page content
rather than snippets. Set `[search] api_key` to your `ay_live_...` key, or the
`SOFYA_API_KEY` env var. This is a search-tool backend only; it does not add a
Sofya model provider.

```toml
[search]
provider = "searxng" # duckduckgo | bing | tavily | bocha | metaso | searxng | baidu | volcengine | sofya
# base_url = "https://search.example/" # optional with provider = "duckduckgo"; required with "searxng"
# api_key = "YOUR_KEY" # required for tavily, bocha, metaso, baidu, volcengine, and sofya; unused by searxng
```

## Local Media Attachments

Use `@path/to/file` in the composer to add local text file or directory context
to the next message. Use `/attach <path>` for local image/video media paths, or
`Ctrl+V` to attach an image from a local clipboard or an explicitly forwarded
X11/Wayland clipboard. SSH terminal paste without a forwarded graphical display
is text-only; use the local terminal's paste command (`Cmd+V` on macOS or
`Ctrl+Shift+V` on Linux/Windows), and use `/attach <path>` for remote image
files. OpenSSH loopback X11 displays are detected automatically. For an
explicitly forwarded Wayland or non-loopback X11 display, set
`CODEWHALE_SSH_CLIPBOARD=graphical`; set it to `terminal` to force terminal
transfer instead of an ambient remote display. DeepSeek's public Chat
Completions API currently accepts text message
content, so media attachments are sent as explicit local path references instead
of native image/video payloads.
Attachment rows appear above the composer before submit; move to the start of
the composer, press `↑` to select an attachment row, then press `Backspace` or
`Delete` to remove it without editing the sample text by hand.

## Managed Configuration and Requirements

codewhale supports a policy layering model:

1. user config + profile + env overrides
2. managed config (if present)
3. requirements validation (if present)

By default on Unix:
- managed config: `/etc/deepseek/managed_config.toml`
- requirements: `/etc/deepseek/requirements.toml`

Requirements file shape:

```toml
allowed_approval_policies = ["on-request", "untrusted", "never"]
allowed_sandbox_modes = ["read-only", "workspace-write"]
```

If configured values violate requirements, startup fails with a descriptive error.

See `docs/capacity_controller.md` for formulas, intervention behavior, and telemetry.

## Notes On `codewhale-tui doctor`

`codewhale-tui doctor` follows the same config resolution rules as the rest of the
TUI. That means `--config`, `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH`, and the legacy
`DEEPSEEK_CONFIG_PATH` are respected, and MCP/skills
checks use the resolved `mcp_config_path` / `skills_dir` (including env overrides).

To bootstrap missing MCP/skills paths, run `codewhale-tui setup --all`. You can
also run `codewhale-tui setup --skills --local` to create a workspace-local
`./skills` dir.

`codewhale-tui doctor --json` prints a machine-readable report that skips the
live API connectivity probe. Plain `doctor` keeps the existing hosted-provider
connectivity check, but it does not contact loopback or self-hosted provider
endpoints unless `--probe-local` is supplied. That opt-in request may start a
desktop-managed local service such as Ollama. Top-level keys: `version`,
`config_path`, `config_present`, `workspace`, `api_key.source`, `base_url`,
`default_text_model`, `mcp`, `skills`, `tools`, `plugins`, `sandbox`,
`platform`, `api_connectivity`, `capability`. CI consumers should rely on `api_key.source`
(`env`/`config`/`missing`) rather than parsing the human-readable `doctor`
text.

If configuration loading or validation fails, `doctor --json` returns nonzero
and prints a bounded, secret-redacted JSON error envelope with
`status = "error"` and `error.kind = "config_validation"`. It does not emit a
normal route or capability report for an invalid configuration.

MCP entries are configuration diagnostics unless an explicit MCP command is
run. `mcp.probe_scope` is `configuration`, `mcp.live_health_checked` is false,
and each server separates `checks.configuration` / `checks.command` from
`checks.process_reachable`, `checks.protocol_initialized`, and
`checks.backend_tool_health`. The latter three remain `not_checked` in doctor
output. Run `codewhale mcp validate` to explicitly start enabled servers and
verify protocol initialization/discovery; backend health still requires an
appropriate explicit tool call.

The `capability` key contains per-provider capability info derived from
static knowledge (release docs, API guides) rather than live API probes.
Top-level sub-keys: `resolved_provider`, `resolved_model`, `context_window`,
`max_output`, `thinking_supported`, `cache_telemetry_supported`,
and `request_payload_mode`.

Use `capability.context_window` and `capability.max_output` for model-limit
checks in CI scripts; do not treat `capability.max_output` as the per-turn
request budget. Use `capability.thinking_supported` to decide whether to
configure reasoning effort.

## Setup status, clean, and extension dirs

`codewhale-tui setup` accepts a few flags beyond the existing `--mcp`,
`--skills`, `--local`, `--all`, and `--force`:

- `--status` — print a compact one-screen status (api key, base URL, model,
  MCP/skills/tools/plugins counts, sandbox, `.env` presence). Read-only and
  network-free; safe to run in CI. If `.env` is missing and `.env.example` is
  present in the workspace, the status output points at `cp .env.example .env`.
- `--tools` — scaffold `~/.codewhale/tools/` with a `README.md` describing the
  self-describing frontmatter convention (`# name:` / `# description:` /
  `# usage:`) and an `example.sh` that follows it. The directory is
  intentionally not auto-loaded; wire individual scripts into the agent via
  MCP, hooks, or skills.
- `--plugins` — scaffold `~/.codewhale/plugins/` with a `README.md` and an
  `example/plugin.toml` plus a namespaced example Skill. Bundles are discovered
  read-only, untrusted, and disabled; review them through `/plugin` before
  enabling. v0.9.1 activates only declared Skills and MCP servers. See
  [PLUGIN_BUNDLES.md](PLUGIN_BUNDLES.md).
- `--all` now scaffolds MCP + skills + tools + plugins together.
- `--clean` — list `~/.codewhale/sessions/checkpoints/latest.json` and
  `offline_queue.json` if they exist. Legacy
  `~/.deepseek/sessions/checkpoints/` files are not scanned automatically; set
  `CODEWHALE_HOME=~/.deepseek` for a one-off legacy cleanup. Pass `--force` to
  actually remove matched files. This never touches real session history or the
  task queue.

`--status` and `--clean` are mutually exclusive with the scaffold flags.

## Why the engine strips XML/`[TOOL_CALL]` text

codewhale sends and receives tool calls only over the API tool channel
(structured `tool_use` / `tool_call` items). The streaming loop in
`crates/tui/src/core/engine.rs` recognizes a fixed set of fake-wrapper start
markers — `[TOOL_CALL]`, `<codewhale:tool_call`, `<tool_call`, `<invoke `,
`<function_calls>` — and scrubs them from visible assistant text without ever
turning them into structured tool calls. When a wrapper is stripped, the loop
emits one compact `status` notice per turn so the user can see why their
visible text shrank. Treat any change that re-enables text-based tool
execution as a regression; the protocol-recovery tests in
`crates/tui/tests/protocol_recovery.rs` lock the contract.
