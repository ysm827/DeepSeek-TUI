/**
 * #4131 WF-A2 — staged bug fix with worktree implementer + verifier.
 *
 * Expected UI: Implement phase with worktree-isolated implementer, then Verify
 * phase. The verifier checks the returned handoff while confirming the parent
 * workspace remains unchanged until an explicit apply/merge. Write/worktree
 * plans should surface approval when require_approval_for_writes is true.
 *
 * Run: /workflow run docs/examples/dogfood-automatic/wf_a2_staged_bugfix.workflow.js
