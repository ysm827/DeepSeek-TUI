# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add OpenCode Go as a first-class, subscription-backed Chat Completions
  provider with `[providers.opencode_go]`, `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`, and the eight
  models currently documented on its `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Models
  served only through OpenCode Go's Anthropic `/messages` endpoint remain out
  of this narrow route until Codewhale supports per-model wire selection
  (#1481 by @seanthefuturegorilla; implementation harvested from PR #773 by
  @zhangweiii and PR #1050 by @sternelee).

### Fixed

- Keep the Hotbar Setup action list synchronized with keyboard focus when the
  selection moves beyond the visible rows, including Down past `/export`
  (#4418).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-16

Codewhale v0.9.0 replaces the default terminal shell with the underwater
interaction system, makes Operate message-first, and hardens the Fleet,
Workflow, routing, accounting, and release surfaces that support day-to-day
agent work. The release also expands localization and gives the public site a
quieter, docs-first community foundation. Its provider work replaces the old
hand-maintained picker boundary with live ProviderLake discovery and adds the
largest curated model-and-pricing expansion in the project so far.

### Fixed — final integration

- Redact configured, environment, file-backed, and bare active credentials
  from every tool result before it crosses any model-provider wire protocol;
  retrieved spillover content is sanitized again at that boundary. The
  `read_file` tool also refuses CodeWhale configuration, backup, and
  credential-store paths, preventing routine tool use from exposing those
  local files.
- Keep immediate TUI submit failures inside the shell: custom-provider route
  preflight and closed-mailbox errors now restore the exact composer draft and
  selected skill for retry, with a sticky visible error instead of exiting.
- Anchor automatic compaction thresholds to the route's spendable input
  budget after output reservation and safety headroom, so large-output and
  tight self-hosted routes compact before provider context rejection. The TUI
  pre-send gate and warning copy now use the same token threshold as the
  engine. Preserve the 262K Kimi route's usable input budget and use the
  documented 32K default generation budget instead of mirroring the context
  window as output (#4293 by @SamhandsomeLee, #4368 by @bruce6135, and #4378
  by @mvanhorn).
- Fail closed instead of reporting base-rate dollar estimates for direct OpenAI
  GPT-5.4/5.4 Pro, GPT-5.5 (including dated snapshots), and GPT-5.6
  Sol/Terra/Luna requests above 272K input tokens. Exact tiered accounting
  remains deferred to the generalized pricing schema; smaller 5.4 variants,
  GPT-5.5 Pro, Codex subscription, and foreign-provider routes are unchanged
  (#4317).
- Retire `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` before they reach DeepSeek's
  first-party OpenAI or Anthropic wire APIs, migrating both to the documented
  `deepseek-v4-flash` replacement while preserving legacy non-thinking /
  thinking intent when no explicit reasoning tier is set. Aggregator, Wanjie
  Ark, self-hosted, and custom endpoint model ids remain provider-owned (#4320).
- Make Operate a message-first multitask surface: ordinary prompts work without
  a Workflow, direct parent tools follow the same approval, sandbox, shell,
  ask-rule, and repository protections as Act, and follow-ups can queue while
  work is active. Bounded background workers remain preferred for independent,
  parallel, isolated, or long-running work; child handoffs cannot inherit
  standing Full Access, and each dispatch produces one durable completion
  receipt.
- Let personal Fleet profiles in `CODEWHALE_HOME/agents` travel across
  repositories while project profiles in `.codewhale/agents` override them.
  Saving refreshes the live roster, and the UI now says explicitly that profile
  availability does not expand workspace, trust, or filesystem authority.
- Move file-mention discovery onto one bounded, generation-safe background
  worker so a slow filesystem read cannot freeze composer input. Exact paths
  resolve on send; fuzzy matches stay in the completion popup instead of
  silently attaching an arbitrary same-name file (#4365 by @WavesMan, with the
  initial bounded-walk approach from #4367 by @LeoLin990405).
- Keep the opt-in `remember` tool in the model-visible first-turn catalog so
  durable preference capture works without requiring a model to discover a
  tool it cannot yet know exists (#4373 by @Angel-Hair and #4377 by
  @mvanhorn).
- Make `review` handle a staged snapshot relative to a base ref by comparing
  the branch merge-base tree with the index. This preserves committed and
  staged branch work, excludes unstaged edits, and avoids the invalid
  `git diff --cached <base>...HEAD` form.
- Honor each MCP server's advertised discovery capabilities before calling
  optional tools, resources, templates, or prompts; keep optional probes
  independently bounded and fail-soft (#4308 by @nsfoxer).
- Make offline `scorecard` pricing provider-aware: `turn_end` records carry the
  effective route and a non-secret billing surface, runtime exports and
  supported aliases ingest cleanly, legacy/unknown routes remain explicitly
  unpriced, and route-scoped cache and recorded-time pricing replace model-only
  guesses. Historical runtime aggregates use each turn's recorded time;
  costless catalog routes fail closed while exact provider-owned hand-price
  rows remain available. StepFun PAYG and Step Plan usage now stay distinct
  without persisting raw endpoint URLs, so subscription quota is never reported
  as token spend (#4335). Completion-only shell, manual-compaction, and purge
  events remain visible to `turn_end` observers as explicitly non-model
  lifecycle records. This builds on the scorecard introduced by @findshan in
  #3388.
- Preserve named custom-provider identity across TUI sessions, `exec --resume`,
  runtime threads, exports, cache and Workflow receipts. Restores resolve the
  saved provider against live configuration before creating a client, never
  infer a provider from the model ID, and fail closed when the named route was
  removed, invalid, or ambiguous (#4334).
- Bind credentials to the endpoint that owns them. Environment-selected custom
  hosts can no longer inherit saved provider keys, keyring entries, OAuth, or
  ambient provider variables; only an explicitly source-marked CLI key may
  follow an explicit CLI endpoint override. `auth_mode = "none"` also strips
  credential-shaped custom headers consistently in the TUI and app server,
  while keyless loopback routes remain usable as local runtimes.
- Make hosted runtime threads deterministic and provider-exact: serialize
  thread, turn, and event mutation; keep cancellation ownership with the host;
  preserve the selected provider through every durable turn; terminalize
  exceptional streams once; and prevent the runtime manager from silently
  dispatching unclaimed goal continuations or child turns.
- Treat required user confirmation as a real goal blocker instead of a failed
  goal, and explain how to recover when a previously cached approval is denied.
  Cached-denial recovery is also committed as a settled transcript receipt, so
  tool completion or a later status update cannot erase it from scrollback or
  accessibility output. The notice now describes matching, process-scoped
  denials truthfully across all shipped locales; approval audits honor
  `CODEWHALE_HOME`, and expired status toasts cannot remain trapped behind a
  persistent entry. Both states remain visible and actionable instead of
  looking like unexplained model or tool failure (#4374 and #4375 by
  @Angel-Hair, with the final hardening in #4385 by @nightt5879).
- Make Fleet launch and teardown deterministic: route flags are placed before
  `exec`, workers are contained in owned Unix sessions or Windows Job Objects,
  and cancellation reaps surviving descendants with bounded escalation before
  manager state settles. Fence progress, terminal status, verification
  receipts, and evidence by durable attempt generation so a stale process can
  never complete or overwrite a restarted attempt; terminal state and receipt
  now commit atomically, stale-heartbeat decisions use a full lease CAS,
  exhausted-retry alerts are exactly once, and crash-truncated ledger tails are
  quarantined before the next append. Standalone CLI and Runtime API restart
  controls now drive the replacement attempt through a real executor to its
  terminal receipt, while per-run manager ownership prevents concurrent
  controllers from launching the same attempt twice.
- Keep the stopship Workflow fixture bounded to measured 24k-per-turn role
  budgets and a 360k aggregate. Authored child step and wall-time limits now
  reach the live runtime, including launch-queue wait; promoted evidence stays
  intact between roles, tool-free handoff consumers omit tool fields on the
  provider wire, and a terminal `BLOCK` fails the Workflow instead of producing
  a successful Lane receipt. Free-form descriptions no longer fabricate write,
  shell, or network risk; unknown structured risk remains fail-closed.
- Keep repository trust affirmative and explicit: only `1`/`Y` are advertised
  as acceptance keys, while Enter remains non-affirmative and explains the
  required choice.
- Replace literal legal and doctrinal metaphors in Simplified Chinese setup and
  `/constitution` copy with direct collaboration terminology reviewed by a
  native speaker (#4369 by @hmr-BH).
- Keep the transcript reviewable while an inline approval card is active:
  Page Up/Down, modified arrows, Home/End, and the mouse wheel now move through
  the visible evidence without changing or dismissing the pending decision
  (#4371 by @amuthantamil).
- Match generated worker names to the active UI language while preserving
  explicit user names, and tighten the 89x50 shell rhythm across Fleet rows,
  choice dialogs, transcript boundaries, and the idle composer.
- Put docs content and search before the full index on small screens, reduce
  mobile dead space, and keep the public community copy focused on issues,
  pull requests, and international contributors.

### Changed — the underwater shell

- Replace the default TUI shell with the underwater interaction system: one
  renderer owns the header, top work strip, transcript ledger, composer, and
  footer, with explicit compact/normal/wide tiers and no legacy sidebar or
  dashboard in the default path. The legacy composition survives only behind
  the internal `classic` treatment.
- Add a distinct pre-session launch screen — new session, new worktree (with
  inline naming and real lane provisioning), scoped resume count, changelog,
  quit — with reliable non-colliding keys and row/keyboard parity.
- Render turns as a ledger: user message, short narration, settled tool
  receipts, and exactly one live row. Fast tool bursts land directly as
  batch receipts (no spinner churn), completed receipts stay inspectable,
  failures hold a coral receipt with stderr one `v` away, and one shared
  tool rail replaces nested card borders.
- Make completion a one-shot exhale: `working -> finishing -> done` in the
  footer only, with no transcript repaint, no lingering loop, and no stale
  cancel action in the completed state.
- Rebuild the secondary rooms on one hairline grammar — config, setup,
  sessions, help, context, theme, model/route, Fleet, file attach — each
  with a title hairline, row objects with focus/selection/mouse parity,
  one panel-owned scroll rail, and wrapped action footers.
- Make `/model` a model-first atomic route picker across configured
  providers: provider and model switch together on apply, and every row
  prints the resolved model. `/theme` gains a live preview with truthful
  Esc revert across all 12 shipped themes.
- Add a live context inspector (Alt+C) backed by the current route: exact
  system/messages/free token buckets, a proportional map, drill-down into
  the detail pager, and no frozen session while it is open.
- Project Workflow runs as an in-stream run map: a collapsed one-line card
  that unfolds into per-lane rows with role, resolved model, worktree,
  elapsed track, and per-member running/waiting/failed/cancelled/done
  states, plus gates and a debrief built only from real run data. Child
  transcripts never flood the parent shell.
- Unify Fleet into roster/setup/workers rooms: the operator is pinned first
  with the live session route, members show resolved route truth (inherit /
  fast lane / pinned), and the workers tab is a control surface with
  row-local open/stop and real lifecycle counts.
- Distinguish repository-law approvals from ordinary approvals: the
  constitution prompt names its authority, source, matched rule, and target,
  and Full Access never bypasses it. Ordinary approvals render as a still
  coral band above the visible transcript.
- Keep streaming honest and cheap: provider-unit deltas replace per-grapheme
  queueing, the transcript is top-anchored so appended lines stop shifting
  settled rows, ambient animation stops during real work, and ordinary
  completion no longer triggers full-screen clears (verified by render-diff
  logs: suffix updates of tens of cells while streaming, zero periodic
  full repaints).
- Give every underwater treatment ambient life: ombre breathes its water
  column while flat and Terminal-owned keep the idle fish and bubble
  (foreground-only for Terminal), a typed treatment setting replaces string
  comparisons, reduced motion freezes life legibly, `fancy_animations =
  false` stills the chrome, and typing scatters the fish immediately. Fish
  keep a one-cell gap from occupied text; the whale remains the single brand
  mark and returns to stillness between caustic sweeps.
- Bring the whale mark to life with a soft diagonal caustic sweep, then let it
  genuinely rest. Active markers now share a smoother 8 Hz clock after the
  existing earned-motion delay, while reduced motion, hidden/off-screen views,
  modal ownership, and compact-terminal redraw budgets remain authoritative.
  The motion is adapted from the Apache-2.0 Grok Build interaction language,
  not copied as a global pulse or high-frequency receipt cascade.
- Keep compact terminals operable: `/config` and `/resume` collapse
  secondary chrome before sacrificing their selectable rows at 40x12 and
  60x16, bodies budget for the footer's real wrapped height, and the
  selection stays visible through resizes.
- Route footer notices through the classified toast system so informational
  acknowledgements (for example "Auto-compaction enabled") expire instead of
  becoming permanent idle chrome, while warnings and errors hold as sticky
  notices until their window passes.
- Complete the `CODEWHALE_ASCII_SAFE=1` decorative tier: the whale mark,
  context meter, braille state markers (mapped by dot density so the working
  bubble still reads as a rising fill), bubbles, rails, and role/lane glyphs
  all narrow to semantic ASCII while user, model, and CJK text passes
  through untouched. Verified by whole-surface rendered-buffer sweeps.
- Repair the Help catalog to match handler truth (`Alt+G`, `Alt+Shift+G`,
  `Alt+[`, `Alt+]`, `Alt+L`, `Alt+?`), and give theme, Help, model, and
  config rows direct mouse paths with the same activation as Enter.

### Changed — integrated runtime and TUI

- Make worker delegation route-aware and identity-safe: workers receive a
  small role-scoped system prompt instead of stale parent/model boilerplate,
  faster routes resolve through the configured provider, and opening a worker
  shows its complete available transcript. Remove `token_budget` from the
  ordinary model-facing Agent schema so agents do not micromanage ad-hoc
  launches; explicit legacy calls remain readable for compatibility.
- Mature `/config` interaction for enumerated and boolean settings with
  pickers/toggles, mouse-wheel scrolling, stable focus, and configured-provider
  selection. Startup mode is now only Agent or Plan; legacy `operate`/`yolo`
  settings migrate to Agent with permission posture represented separately.
- Show where effective permission policy comes from and keep profile,
  environment, project, managed, and requirements-controlled posture read-only
  in the in-session editor. Runtime presets edit only proven user-owned root
  settings and no longer persist temporary environment overlays.
- Restore the original four-line whale mark and make ambient ocean motion
  coherent across the full scroll surface: one continuous ombre, eased fish
  that face their direction of travel, fish in otherwise blank scrollback, and
  explicit reduced-motion and animation controls.
- Keep model reasoning in the transcript rather than the Tasks strip, retain
  the live header status indicator, separate worker and success colors, and use
  the same rail grammar for both work-strip and transcript scrollbars.
- Present the default Z.AI Coding Plan route, including child routes, as
  subscription quota instead of estimated per-token dollars. No undocumented
  account endpoint is called by this change.

### Added

- Thinking Machines Lab's Inkling through Together using the exact wire model
  `thinkingmachines/inkling`, with `inkling` and `together-inkling` aliases and
  exact `none` / `minimal` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `max` reasoning
  values. Codewhale does not invent a context window, price, or offline picker
  claim while the provider's public catalog metadata remains inconsistent.
- Expand the verified offline catalog with Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5,
  GPT-5.3 Codex, and Qwen3.7 Plus, including time-aware Sonnet 5 introductory
  pricing and explicit cache rates. Refresh stale GLM-5.1, Kimi K2.6, Trinity,
  Qwen3.6, Nemotron, Anthropic, GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.7 Code, GLM-5 Turbo, and
  GPT-5 Codex price or limit rows; keep Xiaomi MiMo explicitly unpriced where
  the provider's token plan and pay-as-you-go surfaces cannot be distinguished.
- MiniMax Messages provider support for MiniMax-M3 and MiniMax-M2.7, with
  OpenAI-compatible and Messages routes, regional endpoint guidance, request
  coverage, catalog limits, and tier-aware pricing (PR #4354 by @octo-patch).
- Dynamic MCP server infrastructure and an approval-gated tool that lets the
  model start a configured MCP server from chat context. Harvested from
  #3869 and #3866 by @bistack with authorship preserved.
- Parent `--disallowed-tools` restrictions now flow into sub-agents and Fleet
  workers by default, including deny-wins, wildcard, catalog-filtering, and
  multi-generation inheritance coverage. Harvested from #4096 by @JayBeest
  (#4042).
- Korean (ko) UI locale with full key parity and onboarding/setup wiring
  (PR #4347 by @moduvoice).
- Localize the entire underwater layer: 104 new UI strings — launch menu,
  phase words, mode/permission chips, footer hints, session picker, context
  inspector, route and theme pickers, Fleet roster, workflow status, sidebar
  work strip, repository-law approval copy, and file-attach titles — wired
  through MessageIds and translated into ja, zh-Hans, es-419, pt-BR, vi,
  and ko. Every complete pack now holds exact raw key parity with English
  (856 keys), enforced by new tests that the old English-fallback gate could
  not perform. The permission chip maps from typed state, so localization
  can never silently collapse it. Machine-authored translations follow each
  pack's existing terminology and are flagged for native review.
- Anthropic adapter: sanitize top-level `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf` in tool
  input schemas so affected tools no longer fail the whole request with
  HTTP 400 (PR #4346 by @qinlinwang).
- Anthropic pricing: bill cache-write tokens at published rates
  (PR #4348 by @knqiufan, #4318).
- NetBSD: generate QuickJS bindings at build time so `codewhale-workflow-js`
  compiles (PR #4349 by @ci4ic4).
- Real-PTY release gates for six-worker fan-out liveness with Esc cancel,
  multi-terminal route isolation, queued steering via terminal-safe Ctrl+G
  (with Ctrl+S retained where the terminal forwards it), the one-shot
  completion footer, and per-theme ANSI output for every shipped palette.

### Fixed

- Make release publication complete and source-anchored: every build checks out
  the resolved tag commit, tag movement is rejected before GHCR, GitHub
  Release, Homebrew, Cargo, or npm writes, and registry helpers require a clean
  checkout exactly matching the remote tag. Manual recovery runs are
  exact-tag-only and execute the same parity gate as automatic tag pushes.
- Publish a coherent distribution set: both checksum manifests now contain
  usable public basenames and cover the full 29-asset matrix; GHCR, Homebrew,
  GitHub archives, and the Linux x64 CNB mirror carry `codewhale`, `codew`, and
  `codewhale-tui`. The CNB shortcut now fails clearly outside Linux/OpenHarmony
  x64 instead of promising assets that the mirror does not build.
- Preserve task text when a skill is invoked through dollar, unified-slash, or
  explicit skill syntax, while keeping bare skill invocations and management
  subcommands intact (PR #4372 by @nightt5879, co-authored by @CCChisato;
  #3915).
- Honor MCP server discovery capabilities: require advertised or legacy
  `tools/list`, keep optional resource/template/prompt probes independently
  bounded and fail-soft, and format descriptions Unicode-safely (#4308,
  harvested with co-authorship from @nsfoxer).
- Age-evict terminal sub-agent worker records from the state ledger so
  long-lived, high-fan-out sessions do not keep rewriting multi-megabyte
  terminal history (#4217; root-cause and fix direction from @yekern).
- Resolve the sub-agent completion/cancellation race with one terminal-state
  claim: cancellation suppresses late mailbox/parent/UI delivery, while a
  completed result remains publicly running until its notification is safely
  delivered.
- Keep Workflow panel controls from stealing ordinary composer letters. Enter,
  Delete, Up/Down, and Esc own panel actions; typed characters return focus to
  the composer and start the message normally.
- Preserve the composer prompt gutter from the first typed character through
  wrapping, scrolling, cursor placement, and mouse hit-testing so the `>` does
  not disappear or make input appear to jump.
- Emit terminal-native OSC 8 metadata for rendered URLs without placing escape
  payload bytes in the measured text, keeping long links visible, selectable,
  and clickable in supporting terminals.

- Keep headless structured output terminal-clean: `codewhale exec` engines
  no longer emit interactive terminal-title/taskbar OSC sequences, so
  `--output-format stream-json` stdout stays parseable, escape-free JSONL.
  Interactive TUI sessions keep their terminal chrome.
- Localization honesty: the parity gate was blinded by its own English
  fallback — two keybinding rows (`KbCyclePermissions`, `KbCycleThinking`)
  were missing from all five "complete" packs and now ship translated; the
  Operate-mode copy that drifted in English was retranslated in every pack
  (including zh-Hant's slice); three MessageIds absent from
  ALL_MESSAGE_IDS are visible to tests again; and the `/config`
  theme/locale hints and the invalid-locale error derive from the shipped
  registries instead of stale hand lists that advertised 4 of 12 themes
  and 4 of 8 locales.
- The setup wizard's constitution step no longer claims a "55-line core"
  in any language (the bundled core is larger today); the guided draft says
  "the bundled core stays active" instead.
- In-app selection copy is rail-clean and now regression-tested: copied
  transcript text excludes the `▎ ╎ │ ●` decorations via cache metadata
  (#4208 — thanks @eugenicum for the report and code-aware fix direction;
  terminal-native selection with mouse capture off remains a product
  decision on the proposed `rail_style` option).

### Docs

- Stamp every 0.9-era roadmap document with an explicit status (current,
  historical, superseded, principle-only, or future RFC), correct trackers
  that recorded unshipped work as done, and describe what remains after
  v0.9.0 in `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.
- Add `docs/rfcs/UNIFIED_PROVIDER_LOGIN.md`: one `codewhale auth login`
  surface for Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, and xAI, with the Anthropic adapter
  gated on verifying flow permissions before any constants are adopted.
- Refresh `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` for treatment-independent ambient life
  and the completed ASCII tier.

### Changed — runtime foundations

- Make the advertised Android/Termux release target buildable by generating
  QuickJS bindings against the Android NDK instead of expecting an upstream
  pre-generated `aarch64-linux-android` binding file, and give Android CLI/TUI
  HTTP clients a preconfigured rustls root store (Mozilla WebPKI roots) so
  standalone Termux processes stop panicking inside
  `rustls-platform-verifier`'s JVM expectations (#4236, #4242).
- Rebalance the bundled Constitution after the v0.8.67 prompt ablation: keep
  the procedural policy tail in mode-specific layers, while restoring concise
  behavioral guidance for momentum, causal investigation, constraint-first
  decisions, mechanism-backed guarantees, and clean continuity.
- Wire live catalog cache into provider/model pickers without dropping stale or
  prior rows after TTL expiry / refresh failure (#4139). Remove the dead
  `OFFERING_SEEDS` hand table so the bundled Models.dev catalog is the sole
  seed source; pickers show a compact `stale` / `cache failed` chrome chip when
  the Models.dev layer is past TTL or last refresh failed.
- Make `work_update` the sole model-facing To-do / Work progress tool (#4132).
  `checklist_*` and `todo_*` remain registered as hidden compat aliases for
  transcript replay; `update_plan` stays Strategy metadata/context/route, not
  a second checklist. Mode/approval prompts nudge the single surface.
- Demote the bundled Models.dev snapshot to an offline/stale fallback after
  live catalog refresh (#4188). ProviderLake precedence is live Models.dev >
  bundled seed > legacy hardcoded completion names; pickers, inventory, and
  subagent validation stay catalog-backed, and Codewhale-only providers keep
  defaults when Models.dev has no rows.

### Added
- Wire xAI device-code OAuth into `codewhale auth xai-device`, the TUI
  `/auth xai-device` command, and guided provider setup, with comment-preserving
  auth-mode persistence and loopback exchange coverage (#4257).
- Add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna to the OpenAI API route, including their
  1.05M context metadata, 128K output limits, pricing, and `max` reasoning
  effort. Add Meta Model API as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider for
  Muse Spark 1.1 with 1M context, tool/reasoning metadata, provider aliases,
  and both `META_MODEL_API_KEY` and Meta's `MODEL_API_KEY` credential names.
- Catalog automation: `scripts/catalog_models_dev.py` refreshes secret-free
  Models.dev / OpenRouter listings and validates the offline seed snapshot
  (`snapshot --check`) without ever persisting API keys (#4117).
- `/model` picker cycles six catalog views with `A` (Configured → Catalog →
  Recent → Coding → Cheap → Long context) and richer row metadata from the
  live/bundled catalog (context, max output, tools, reasoning, price/M,
  freshness). Discoverability views do not auto-apply a surprising route
  (#4115).

- Workflow runs are now durable: every run appends to a
  `.codewhale/workflow-runs.jsonl` journal and hydrates on startup, so
  `workflow status` survives restarts; runs left `running` by a dead process
  are recovered as failed (#4011). The transcript renders workflow tool
  output as a run card (status, goal, children, progress, verification)
  instead of a generic one-liner (#4038), and `workflow` accepts a `verify`
  flag that runs post-completion verification gates and fails the run when
  gates fail (#4013).
- Hotbar sources for MCP tools and skills: MCP tool slots prefill the
  composer (execution stays behind the normal tool-approval flow) and skill
  slots activate through the existing `$skill` alias (#2068, #2069).
- Mode & permission surface: Tab cycles Plan → Act → Operate; Shift+Tab
  cycles the Agent permission posture (Ask / Auto-Review / Full Access) with
  a footer permission chip; Ctrl+T cycles reasoning effort and Ctrl+Shift+T
  opens the live transcript overlay. Operate is the orchestration mode
  (delegate, wait, inspect, dispatch) and raises sub-agent fan-out while
  focusing the Agents sidebar.
- Provider lake facade: the provider/model pickers, hotbar, and model
  inventory now enumerate configured providers' models from the bundled
  catalog (with an `A` toggle to browse the full catalog), replacing the
  hardcoded per-provider model table (#3830 follow-up).
- Added Cursor-integrated-terminal dogfood evidence for the published v0.8.67
  release, covering installed binary provenance, release/publication checks,
  headless runtime smoke, setup QA, and remaining manual visual TUI checks.
- README and README.zh-CN now point users to the community-maintained
  CodeWhale for VS Code GUI frontend while clarifying that this repository's
  `extensions/vscode/` scaffold remains the read-only Phase 0 viewer (#4035).

### Fixed

- Sub-agent waiting no longer peek→sleep polls: `agent(action="wait")` joins
  children, unchanged peeks are throttled (~30s) with an anti-polling nudge,
  and mode prompts teach the join primitive (#4097). Harvested from PR #4098
  by [@Mr-Moon121](https://github.com/Mr-Moon121) (Jeffrey Luna).
- `/provider` picker remembers catalog/configured view and highlighted row
  across reopen, matching `/model` picker memory.
- Mode picker roster is exactly Act / Plan / Operate (no Multitask, no
  numeric `4`/`5` gaps). Legacy `yolo`/`4` remain invisible one-way
  permission shorthand for Act + Bypass.

- Fleet setup is a role/profile roster editor, not a provider-scoped model
  picker: the Model step lists routes from every configured provider (not
  only the active one), a picked route's provider is persisted explicitly in
  the saved profile TOML (`provider = "..."`, never inferred from the model
  id), and the loader/route resolver read that field back out verbatim. The
  draft-preview save keypress no longer competes with a separate pager's
  `g`/`G` scroll bindings — the exact TOML preview now renders inline on the
  same Review step that saves it (#4093).
- `codewhale fleet run` and interactive in-process Fleet launches now honor a
  profile-pinned provider/model route instead of merely recording it on the
  receipt. Headless workers receive the non-secret `--provider` and `--model`
  pair; TUI workers resolve the same explicit route in process. Credentials
  still come from the worker's environment, provider is never inferred from a
  model id, and unpinned workers continue to inherit the run route (#4093,
  #4193).
- The Fleet setup `m` model-assisted redraft no longer drops a picked
  cross-provider route: the provider/model the operator chose are re-pinned
  onto the drafted profile (a model draft is always `provider: None`), so
  saving it keeps the explicit route instead of persisting an ambiguous,
  provider-scoped profile (#4093).
- Saving a Fleet profile now fails with a clear message when it pins a
  provider that has no configured credentials, using the same
  configured-provider check the model picker uses (#4093).
- Workflow correctness: completion polling fails closed instead of
  fabricating success when a sub-agent reports no terminal status; cancel
  interrupts the JS VM (cancel handle + abort) and blocks further spawns;
  and `budget.spent()` reports real manager-scope usage instead of always 0.
- Sub-agent spawns validate the model↔provider pair before dispatch:
  inherited/faster routes remap foreign models to the provider's catalog
  default, and explicit pins fail fast with a diagnostic instead of an
  upstream model-not-found error.
- TUI stability: engine event drains break every 8–16 events / 8 ms to keep
  input live (#1830, #2317, #1198); the terminal input pump restarts after
  stall recovery on macOS/Linux too; the startup raw-mode probe no longer
  leaks raw mode on timeout; recovery snapshots persist every 45 s during
  long turns and the offline queue persists on every push (#1830);
  queue/steer paths surface toasts while streaming (#2317, #1338); and
  modal submit errors re-open the modal instead of being swallowed (#1198).
- Core/state: paused jobs persist as paused across restarts; unarchive
  updates the in-memory cache; tool dispatch has a timeout; MCP
  notifications no longer receive responses; corrupted checkpoints surface
  errors instead of loading empty state; the session index compacts instead
  of growing unbounded; and recording thread-goal usage no longer
  self-deadlocks the state store.
- Runtime compaction summaries are now persisted into `/v1` thread records so
  engine reloads and restarts preserve compacted context. Contributed by
  MXAntian (@MXAntian) (#4091).
- The TUI leaves xterm alternate-scroll mode off when mouse capture is disabled,
  preserving native terminal text selection in light-theme/no-mouse-capture
  sessions. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879) (#4088, #4026).
- The public `/api/github/feed` endpoint is now forced dynamic on Cloudflare so
  it returns live GitHub activity instead of a build-time empty feed.

### Security

- Require bearer authentication for `/v1/chat/completions`, compare tokens in
  constant time, return accurate 4xx/5xx statuses, bound request bodies and SSE
  frames, redact secrets from stdio `config get`, and reliably reap the runtime
  child during shutdown.
- Keep trust precedence and secret persistence fail-closed: user ExecPolicy
  rules outrank agent-layer rules, chained commands cannot propose unsafe
  trusted-prefix amendments, and config and secret writes are atomic with
  filesystem synchronization on every supported platform.

### Changed

- Tool-hang watchdog trimmed from 15 minutes to 10 (#1862); approval modal
  footer hints use a higher-contrast tier (#3380); status/mode copy is
  disclosed once across header, footer, cards, and sidebar instead of
  repeated per layer.
- Removed the unused `tui::whale_routes` taxonomy module and its tests.
  Contributed by Darrell Thomas (@DarrellThomas) (#4041, #3852).

### Deprecated

- YOLO mode: `--yolo`, `default_mode = "yolo"`, and the hotbar YOLO action
  now map to Act + Full Access permissions via a compatibility shim and
  show a one-shot deprecation notice. Removal is deferred beyond v0.9.0 so
  this release does not break existing scripts without a dedicated cutover.

### Removed

- Remove the deprecated `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary shims in this
  breaking release. `codewhale`, `codew`, and `codewhale-tui` are the supported
  entry points; existing DeepSeek provider support and legacy config/session
  migration remain intact.

### Known issues

- Android/Termux arm64 remains a preview in v0.9.0. The target, asset wiring,
  updater selection, dependency graph, and source-build path have automated or
  static coverage, but shell/PTY/config/TUI startup and runtime behavior remain
  unverified on a real device (#4236, #4242). Do not use a GNU/Linux arm64
  archive in Termux.

## [0.8.67] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- The model you select in `/model` is now the operator: fleet workers whose
  task spec and roster profile pin no model inherit the active session route
  instead of a hardcoded `auto` sentinel, matching the pinned operator row in
  `/fleet roster`. Task-level and profile model overrides still win, and
  route receipts record which source applied (`task.model`,
  `agent_profile.model`, or `run.model`).
- Added the `/workflow` command (aliases `/workflows`, `/wf`) as the user
  opt-in to workflow orchestration. Bare `/workflow` orchestrates the current
  work — the model synthesizes the objective from the conversation context;
  `/workflow <objective>` narrows the run; `/workflow status [run_id]` and
  `/workflow cancel <run_id>` relay typed run receipts without starting new
  runs.
- Bare `/goal` with no active goal now declares a goal from the conversation
  context via `create_goal` instead of printing usage; with an active goal it
  remains the status readout, and explicit `/goal <objective>` is unchanged.
- Added the constitution-first setup wizard: a unified `/setup` shell with
  resume, back navigation, and skip-retry state; provider/model readiness
  cards with a custom-provider form and provider-picker detail layout; a
  runtime posture card with preset application and project-override warnings;
  a setup verification report; and transactional setup persistence with
  secret redaction and rollback (#3402, #3403, #3404, #3405, #3406, #3410,
  #3411).
- Added a structured user-global constitution with a deterministic renderer,
  prompt-block injection, guided principle authoring with preview and preset
  save, and a `/constitution` manager command as the primary constitution
  management surface, with file state shown in setup and actions surfaced in
  diagnostics (#3793, #3806, #3811).
- Added model-assisted constitution drafting behind an explicit ratify gate
  and fleet-profile drafting behind an explicit preview-before-save gate, with
  untrusted-draft provenance recorded so model-authored text is never applied
  silently. Updating users keep their existing constitution unchanged, and a
  localized constitution checkpoint is required after update (#3794).
- Added the Hotbar route editor v1 with route-switch slot actions and support
  for custom model routes, plus a configured-provider route manager for
  `/provider` and `/model` with a missing-auth handoff into provider key
  entry (#2066, #3830, #3831).
- Added auto-discovery of `.codewhale/rules/` and `.claude/rules/`
  directories as project context, with a total byte-budget cap on the
  assembled rules block. Contributed by maple (@yekern).
- Exposed `context_input_budget_for_route` from the engine so external
  integrations can reuse route budget math. Contributed by hexin
  (@h3c-hexin).
- Added GUI config persistence to the runtime API. Contributed by @gaord.
- Added a website localization matrix with a locale registry and drift
  checks. Harvested from #3763 by @idling11 (#3090).
- Added `doctor` detection of half-applied setup state, and startup milestone
  tracing for boot-performance diagnosis.
- Added a v0.8.67 computer-use dogfood prompt that covers the Cursor-terminal
  QA flow, headless gates, setup, sub-agent completion, Fleet, Workflow, model
  pricing, and release evidence collection.
- Fleet: local worker memory usage is now reported, including retained memory
  while a task is in Running status. Contributed by @cyq1017 (#3901).
- Website: community hub, constitution thesis page and constitution-centered
  homepage, models page generated from the provider registry, docs dark mode
  and full SEO metadata/sitemap coverage, terminal player for real
  constitution traces, and a live star badge and version.
- Added Meituan LongCat as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider
  (`longcat`, with `long-cat`, `meituan-longcat`, and `meituan` aliases),
  `LONGCAT_API_KEY` discovery, the `LongCat-2.0` default model, provider
  picker wiring, model completions, provider docs, and web provider facts.
- Fleet: added per-provider setup cards (Persistence, Constitution, Hotbar,
  Tools/MCP, Remote Runtime) with a unified setup catalog and provider-specific
  credential links. Provider setup progress is persisted transactionally with
  rollback guards, Codex OAuth is kept out of provider key storage, and a
  headless QA contract verifies setup readiness across providers.
- Fleet: added Fleet starter profiles with role-aware loadouts (scout→Fast,
  manager→Inherit, etc.), `/fleet setup` profile-authoring wizard, Fleet
  effective-permission recording, and route intent-source tracking.
- Fleet: added 'operator' as a built-in Fleet roster member — the preferred
  helm Fleet slot for workflow coordination. Operator plans, routes, reviews
  outputs, and calls other Fleet slots as needed. This is a roster role, not a
  separate app mode. The full Operation/Operate-mode architecture is deferred
  to 0.9.0.
- Workflow: declarative workflows now run through the production driver, the
  workflow tool is wired to sub-agent dispatch, public Workflow surfaces are
  renamed, and typed workflow-run and status receipts are emitted for
  debugging and verification.
- Added provider-agnostic Fleet rosters and loadouts: provider-specific
  subagent limits, launch concurrency, and admission caps are derived from
  config without hardcoding any single provider.
- Added Workflow runtime foundations: the internal JS authoring/runtime crates
  compile and replay example workflows. 0.8.67 ships the `/workflow` opt-in,
  production-driver dispatch path, sub-agent task handoff, and typed run/status
  receipts; richer authoring UX and the full TUI run view remain tracked for
  v0.8.68 (#2974, #4038).

### Changed

- Clarified the Fleet coordination hierarchy and made roles carry real
  doctrine: the **operator** (the session's `/model` selection) runs the
  operation and assigns managers to workflows; a **manager** is the middle
  manager of exactly one workflow. The built-in **reviewer** is now explicitly
  adversarial (assume the change is broken, try to refute it), and the review
  sub-agent intro adopts the same framing. Built-in `manager`/`operator`/
  `reviewer` roster members now ship role `instructions` that flow into worker
  prompts on both the Fleet task-spec and agent/workflow `profile:` spawn
  paths; custom profiles override them via the same `instructions` field.
- Removed the decorative Fleet vocabulary that never routed differently:
  the `tool-heavy` slot and the `strong`/`balanced`/`deep-reasoning`/`code`/
  `review`/`tool-heavy` loadout tiers. `inherit` (the operator's route) and
  `fast` (the provider's faster class) remain; retired names in existing
  configs keep parsing (as custom labels) with identical auto routing, and
  the `/fleet setup` model-class step now offers only the real choices.
- Raised the default subagent concurrency for high-throughput fanout:
  `max_subagents` default 20 → 64 (config ceiling 128) and the queued+running
  admission cap 200 → 1024. Users on metered plans who want the old behavior
  can set `max_subagents = 20` in config.toml.
- Renamed the internal `whaleflow` subsystem to `workflow` across the
  workspace: the `codewhale-whaleflow`/`codewhale-whaleflow-js` crates become
  `codewhale-workflow`/`codewhale-workflow-js`, Rust identifiers and JS bridge
  symbols are renamed, the `CODEWHALE_WHALEFLOW_JS_*` environment variables
  become `CODEWHALE_WORKFLOW_JS_*`, and the authoring/RFC docs move to
  `WORKFLOW_AUTHORING.md` and `WORKFLOW_EXTERNAL_MEMORY.md`. Historical
  changelog and retro-ledger entries keep the old name as a record.
- Documented the Homebrew rollout strategy and added a distribution-channel
  check to the release checklist. Harvested from #3760 by @idling11 (#3489).
- Paused Linux RISC-V prebuilt release and nightly artifacts because
  `rquickjs-sys` 0.12.0 does not ship `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` bindings;
  installers, docs, and update paths now treat RISC-V as unsupported until
  upstream bindings or a bindgen-enabled build lands.
- Made the approval prompt calm, compact, and honest, and centered the
  first-run follow-up on the constitution; first-run onboarding now hands off
  into the setup wizard, and the language picker offers every shipped locale
  (#3929).
- Startup performance: boot janitors and store scans no longer block the
  first frame, `@mention` completion no longer re-walks the workspace per
  keystroke, and idle offline-queue clones and duplicate tool-output hashing
  were eliminated.
- Clarified the misleading "Ctrl+B backgrounds this command" shell wording
  (#3859) and the hotbar help shortcuts. Docs contribution by Chanhyo Jung
  (@roian6).
- Documented the enforced repo-law invariants, the constitution flow, and the
  `/fleet setup` profile-authoring wizard; aligned `permissions.toml` action
  docs. Docs contribution by @greyfreedom.
- Bumped web dependencies: wrangler 4.103.0 → 4.107.0, mermaid 11.15.0 →
  11.16.0, vitest 4.1.8 → 4.1.9 (@dependabot).
- Backfilled v0.8.67 regression coverage across sub-agent completion, budget
  exhaustion, delegate ordering, provider onboarding, setup scroll, model
  catalog pricing, Fleet routing, and Workflow gates (#4076).
- Split the large TUI debug command group and palette/theme internals into
  smaller modules without changing user-visible behavior (#4078, #4081).

### Fixed

- Fixed the goal sidebar elapsed timer so completed and blocked goals freeze
  their "completed in {elapsed}" readout instead of ticking forever. Goal state
  now records a `finished_at` instant that both sidebar render paths and the
  engine snapshot clamp elapsed against; `/goal resume` clears the freeze and
  the timer ticks again.
- Fixed paused goals silently un-freezing their sidebar timer: usage keeps
  accruing while paused, and the next goal snapshot used to clear the frozen
  instant. Paused goals now stay frozen until an explicit resume.
- Fixed durable `/goal` progress accounting so usage and continuation updates
  release the shared SQLite connection before re-reading the updated goal,
  unblocking resumed goal loops and full workspace release tests.
- Fixed a scheduled-automation race where deleting an automation while its
  run was being enqueued left the already-created task running untracked;
  the run record is now persisted unconditionally.
- Removed `panic = "abort"` from the release profile: it disabled unwinding
  and broke the panic supervision that keeps one failing tool call from
  taking down the whole session. The `lto`/`strip`/`codegen-units` size and
  speed tuning is unchanged.
- Fixed session save/load to persist and restore the active model provider
  across restarts. Previously sessions created under one provider (e.g.
  DeepSeek) would silently load under a different active provider. Provider,
  subagent limits, fallback chain, context window, and reasoning effort are now
  restored from saved session metadata, with `"deepseek"` as the default for
  legacy sessions.
- Raised the streamed model-response idle timeout and matched the TUI stall
  watchdog to the configured stream budget so long reasoning pauses are not
  recovered as stalled turns (#2487, #3998).
- Fixed Codex OAuth/sub-agent release diagnostics so `auth list` reports an
  active Codex OAuth file, Responses API child requests encode inherited tool
  names safely, rate-limited child requests checkpoint as resumable provider
  interruptions, and failure records surface the real Responses API error
  (#3884).
- Fixed fresh launch/setup testing with an explicit `CODEWHALE_HOME` so
  config, settings, theme prefs, and doctor legacy-state diagnostics do not
  inherit unrelated ambient `~/.deepseek` files (#4001, #4002).
- Sub-agent state now persists to `.codewhale/` instead of the lingering
  pre-rebrand `.deepseek/` path (#3864). Contributed by Stime (@yekern).
- `/plugin enable|disable` now persists across restarts (#3918), and the
  plugin command is hidden from the root slash menu and kept canonical after
  the scanner merge. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879).
- `/config ask-rules` now shows ask rule actions with improved diagnostics,
  with file-rule action precedence under test. Contributed by @greyfreedom.
- Fleet/sub-agents: enforced an absolute recursion-depth ceiling and widened
  task-id entropy, gave each atomic state write a unique temp path, kept
  sub-agent tool catalogs in parent parity (#3836), and made the Agents
  sidebar reconcile sub-agent completion and cancellation live (#3837).
- Fixed apply_patch mangling newlines, defaulted fuzz to 3, and made writes
  atomic; fixed compaction to preserve pins on emergency compaction, harden
  the summary fallback, and count image tokens; corrected backtrack boundary,
  checkpoint clear ordering, prune guard, and durable rename.
- Fixed the SSE client to flush the final frame, join multi-line data fields,
  and stop corrupting multibyte UTF-8 split across network reads.
- Kept review-only turns read-only, aliased `auto` mode to the agent policy,
  showed the mode-derived safety policy in status (contributed by @cyq1017),
  and stopped the durable-review floor from holding routine YOLO work
  (#3883).
- Fixed self-update to prefer exact binary release assets. Contributed by
  @LI-Jialu.
- UI polish: stopped constitution and fleet-profile model drafts from
  freezing the event loop, scoped the context-menu backdrop to the popup
  rect, stacked model-picker panes on narrow modals, unified display-width
  helpers on one contract (#3924), removed misleading success toasts,
  issue-number leaks, and dead-end empty states, and repaired the onboarding
  trust and api-key keys.
- Fixed the onboarding Trust step so plain Enter no longer silently grants
  workspace trust; users must choose the explicit trust or exit keys.
- Fixed same-root skill-name collisions being silently shadowed; duplicate
  normalized skill names now warn while keeping discovery deterministic
  (#3919).
- Normalized discovered skill names, removed unenforced trust copy, and
  surfaced the gated constitution override in prompts.
- Fixed a parallel `subagent::` suite flake where one test's process-wide
  `Retry-After` pause could strand unrelated budget-capped workers for the
  full stale window; requests now re-poll the global pause in bounded slices
  and the rate-limit test clears the window on drop.
- Sub-agent and Fleet reliability now fail empty, step-limited, and
  budget-exhausted children with explicit diagnostics instead of silent
  `Completed (no output)` success; budget exhaustion preserves partial output,
  `worktree: true` discovers one-level nested repos from harness directories,
  and completion-before-start delegate events recover into named rows instead
  of ellipsis-only identities (#4050, #4051, #4052, #4053).
- Goal-mode writing and research tasks can complete with
  `verification.status = "not_applicable"` without triggering continuation
  loops (#4054).
- First-run onboarding routes API keys through the selected provider, setup
  wizard bodies scroll with PageUp/PageDown, shipped locale packs are back to
  `en.json` parity with zh-Hant explicitly partial, stable feature flags stay
  out of Experimental, and model/provider rows include current LongCat and
  sourced-pricing hints (#4056, #4057, #4058, #4062, #4063).
- Running tool rows animate while a lone foreground tool is active, and
  workflow receipts render run/status/failure cards instead of one-line or
  null-success output (#4059).
- Model-facing turn metadata now includes a compact git workspace snapshot and
  escalates context pressure at the same thresholds as the TUI, helping agents
  narrow scope or compact before truncation (#4071, #4073).
- Successful child sub-agent completions inline the child's `EVIDENCE` block
  before the completion sentinel, so parents can cite child findings without
  re-running tools (#4072).
- Deferred tools hydrate and execute in the same batch when the original
  arguments are valid, and `[tools].always_load` now keeps configured MCP tools
  active instead of forcing the first-call retry. Thanks @SparkofSpike for the
  hot-path MCP report (#4074, #4027).
- New commit-range co-author checks reject bot/tool trailers on newly pushed
  commits; historical release-range cleanup remains a separate maintenance
  concern (#4075).
- Fixed fuzzy `edit_file` matching so matches that begin with multibyte UTF-8
  characters, including CJK text, advance on character boundaries instead of
  panicking. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879), reported by Taixin Guo
  (@taixinguo) (#3971, #4045).
- Fixed Unix dispatcher/TUI output under early-closing pipes such as
  `codewhale doctor | head` by restoring the default `SIGPIPE` handler before
  printing and propagating signal exits quietly. Contributed by @aznikline,
  reported by @BrathonBai (#4030, #4043).
- Suppressed dead_code warnings in the unused plugin registry module and
  fixed formatting across the command-group files. Contributed by Paulo Aboim
  Pinto (@aboimpinto).
- Pointed the website Community nav link at the community hub.

### Security

- MCP client hardening: closed an SSE-endpoint SSRF, bounded the HTTP
  response body via Content-Length instead of a streaming read, bounded stdio
  line reads to prevent OOM denial of service, fixed a dead timeout, and
  removed an unbounded buffer.
- Made execpolicy deny/trust rules segment-aware, closing a command-chaining
  bypass.
- Closed repo-law and safety-floor bypasses found by adversarial review:
  protected invariants are now enforced as mechanism, the destroyer gap in
  the safety floor is closed, a catalog-present tool with no execution path
  now fails closed, `web_run` open/click is classified as destructive, and
  the allow-list gained wildcard and case handling.
- Refused symlinked rules directories to prevent workspace escape via
  discovered rules. Contributed by maple (@yekern).
- Bounded Fleet sub-agent worker output so fanout cannot exhaust TUI memory
  (#3882), and preserved event headroom for progress. Contributed in part by
  @cyq1017.
- Added an untrusted constitution-draft gate with authoring provenance so
  model-drafted constitutions require explicit human ratification.

### Removed

- Removed unused model-registry helpers. Harvested from #3872 by @cyq1017.
- Removed unused request-tuning metadata. Harvested from #3871 by @cyq1017.
- Removed dead fleet task helpers (#3894 by @cyq1017), the unused
  approval-cache container (#3845) and localization QA metadata (both by
  @nightt5879), the dormant tab collaboration subsystem (#3838), the legacy
  flash auto-router (#3839), the stale project_doc loader (#3840), ignored
  mock LLM placeholders (#3841), dead model-catalog helpers (#3842), the
  unused execpolicy amend module, and dead MCP/client retry helpers.
- Retired the deprecated `WHALE.md` context fallback (#3798).

## [0.8.66] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added `codewhale doctor` / `codewhale doctor --json` legacy-state
  diagnostics that compare known `~/.deepseek` state paths with their
  `~/.codewhale` counterparts and flag unmigrated or dual-root data (#3727).
- Added Sakana AI Fugu as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider with
  `sakana`/`fugu` aliases, `FUGU_API_KEY` / `SAKANA_API_KEY` discovery,
  provider-picker wiring, model completions, and provider docs. Harvested from
  #3748 by @lerugray.
- Added WhaleFlow-to-Fleet launch-shape validation: the default Fleet workflow
  contract allows up to 100 total agents and 5 recursive rings, requires
  bounded loops/expands before launch, and preserves per-slot model selection.
- Added a read-only `/config ask-rules` view for the resolved
  `permissions.toml` path, file status, rule count, and configured
  tool/command/path ask rules. Merged from #3569 by @greyfreedom.
- Added provider-level `context_window` overrides so OpenAI-compatible
  gateways and self-hosted providers can budget against their real model
  context window (#3545).
- Added the native `codew` shim to release archives, Windows installer inputs,
  local release-asset preparation, and checksum verification so manual installs
  receive the same short command that Cargo installs build.
- Added OpenModel as a first-class Anthropic Messages provider, with config,
  CLI, provider picker, docs, and registry coverage. Harvested from #3585 by
  @noaft.
- Added WeCom Bridge deployment and security documentation, with shipped
  runtime/bridge commands and approval-timeout environment guidance. Harvested
  from #3640 by @pkeging.
- Added a token/cache/cost `scorecard` command for offline release gating,
  baseline regression checks, and per-turn cost visibility (#3388). Stream-JSON
  exec metadata now also reports conservative `input_analysis` and
  `visible_final_answer_chars`, so benchmark harnesses can measure transcript
  growth and final-answer bloat without guessing (#2956, #2957).
- Added a release evidence ledger for v0.8.66 and opened the external ACP
  registry submission for CodeWhale after validating the published
  `codewhale@0.8.65` ACP auth handshake against the upstream registry checker
  (#3192).
- Added a typed `[verifier]` config table for the verifier-preview lane, with
  `enabled` and the shipped `verdict_policy = "hunt"` mapping documented and
  validated (#2093).
- Added Hotbar `Alt+1`–`Alt+8` quick-slot switching with decision-card key
  disambiguation, plus an introductory card that explains and can dismiss the
  Hotbar (#3796, #3788).
- Release/docs hygiene: guarded public install/version snippets and the npm
  `codewhaleBinaryVersion` pointer against drift, made `check-docs`/`check-facts`
  fail on stale snippets or unmapped providers, and stopped `sync-changelog`
  from dropping a release when only `[Unreleased]` exists (#3767, #3768, #3769,
  #3770, #3771, #3772).

### Changed

- Deferred Auto mode from the user-facing mode picker, cycle, hotbar, `/mode`
  command, and runtime-thread mode overrides until it has a distinct prompt and
  auto-review behavior; existing `auto` mode text now folds back to Agent
  instead of selecting a hollow mode, and approval modal copy no longer implies
  the current mode is YOLO (#3730, #3733).
- Clarified the Fleet setup surface and docs so Fleet is treated as the durable
  sub-agent configuration layer while WhaleFlow is the agent-authored
  orchestration plan that selects and monitors Fleet slots.
- Slimmed the default Constitution prompt while keeping its required structural
  anchors under regression coverage, reducing the static prompt footprint for
  cache-sensitive turns (#2953).
- Made the approval prompt inline and bottom-anchored instead of a full-screen
  takeover, so context and controls stay visible while a tool awaits a decision
  (#3799).
- The Hotbar is now hidden by default until explicit setup opt-in (#3807); the
  interactive Agent shell also defaults to approval-gated on with a shared
  baseline (#3756).
- Mode authority now resolves approval prompts through a single authority
  source instead of per-surface checks (#3795).

### Fixed

- Surfaced legacy state relocation with a user-visible migration notice whenever
  `~/.deepseek/<state>` is moved or copied into `~/.codewhale/<state>`, so
  upgraded users know their data was preserved and where the canonical state
  now lives (#3726).
- Restored legacy `.deepseek/sessions` visibility for upgraded installs where
  an empty `~/.codewhale/sessions` directory already existed, by copying
  missing legacy session entries into the primary CodeWhale session store
  without overwriting newer data (#3724).
- Calmed approval risk classification for read-only shell commands such as
  `codewhale --version`, `codewhale --help`, and `git status --porcelain` so
  the modal no longer labels proven read-only shell as destructive (#3730).
- Added provider/model route columns to `/cache` turn telemetry so DeepSeek
  cache-hit regressions can be correlated with Auto route changes (#3738).
- Fixed runtime API approval handling so workspace trust no longer auto-resolves
  ordinary tool approvals; trust now only participates in full-access retry
  decisions while YOLO/auto-approve remains the approval bypass (#3736).
- Fixed modal surfaces so the shared view stack paints an opaque backdrop before
  any overlay, while Plan/request-input popup interiors stay opaque and the Plan
  confirmation footer keeps action choices visible on narrow terminals (#3732).
- Added a turn-loop Plan-mode guard for file-writing tools and write-capable MCP
  tools so Plan's "no writes" promise is enforced before approval or execution,
  not only by the sandbox/catalog layer (#3734).
- Preserved the durable review safety floor for publish-like shell actions in
  YOLO mode, so `cargo publish`, `npm publish`, and tag/release pushes force
  approval instead of silently auto-approving (#3735).
- Fixed Ctrl+O external-editor freezes where CodeWhale's terminal input pump
  could keep reading keys while Vim/editor owned the terminal, especially in
  Windows mintty/cygwin shells. Thanks @buko for the precise repro (#3657).
- Hardened the OHOS dependency drift check against transient Cargo registry EOFs
  by retrying the dependency graph probe before failing CI.
- Updated the `/links` provider fallback to the current CodeWhale docs URL and
  added a Baidu Qianfan docs link. Harvested from #3621 by @noaft.
- Hardened `CODEWHALE_TOOL_SURFACE=shell-only` for benchmark/exec runs: the
  shell-only surface hides native tools from the model-visible catalog, and
  unknown `CODEWHALE_TOOL_SURFACE` values now warn instead of silently falling
  back to the full tool surface (#2954).
- Sub-agent fanout and lock hot paths: preserved event-channel headroom for
  progress events (#3783, thanks @cyq1017), let independent sub-agent starts
  join a single parallel dispatch batch instead of serializing (#3801), rendered
  the sub-agent sidebar/ListSubAgents from a read-only snapshot with bounded
  cleanup (#3803), used nonblocking best-effort sends for ListSubAgents refresh
  while still awaiting critical events (#3802), moved sub-agent state
  persistence disk I/O off the manager write lock (#3805), and used `try_lock`
  for shell-manager refresh in async UI paths (#3804).
- Provenance: runtime continuations and `SubAgentHandoff` now inherit standing
  YOLO authority, while `MemoryRecall`, `ImportedTranscript`, and
  `AssistantGenerated` inputs remain guarded (#3817).
- Approval honesty: labeled session-scoped approvals accurately instead of
  "always", and surfaced approval decisions in tool results (#3766).

## [0.8.65] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Provider/model/route resolution (EPIC #2608).** Canonical provider, model,
  offering, and route types with a single `RouteResolver` that produces a
  resolved `ReadyRouteCandidate` (endpoint, wire protocol, model id, context
  limit, price) for every switch (#3458, #3084, #3384). The executing client is
  now constructed from the resolved candidate rather than re-derived from config
  (#3384). A committed, network-free Models.dev-shaped catalog gives models real
  context windows and pricing, with a secret-free live cache (#3497, #3498,
  #3385). Offering pricing with provenance is projected onto candidates (#3501,
  #3085), and route limits feed a route-aware context-budget service (#3508,
  #3523, #3086).
- **Fleet execution substrate (EPIC #3154).** Fleet profile types and config
  (#3469), durable manager resume, workspace agent-profile loading resolved into
  the worker runtime (#3367), loadout intent carried in task specs (#3512), and
  receipts that persist the resolved route for inspection (#3154, #3166). Worker
  status is folded into the unified `/fleet` surface and exposed through the
  Runtime API.
- **Provider surfaces.** A `/provider` readiness dashboard with reasoning
  readiness, an experimental/supported maturity marker, and an "open models for
  this provider" action (#3083, #2984, #3485); cross-provider `/model` search
  with scroll and provider type-ahead (#3484, #3075); inline `<think>`
  reasoning-stream routing with per-provider overrides (#3222); usage telemetry
  normalized into canonical token classes including Responses cache-miss and
  reasoning tokens (#2961, #3509); and remote MCP OAuth login with bearer/header
  auth precedence (#3527).
- **More providers and routes.** User-defined OpenAI-compatible custom providers
  via `[providers.<name>]` (#1519); a DeepSeek Anthropic-compatible route (#2963,
  #3449); a Qianfan route (#3425); Zhipu folded into Z.ai with equal-treatment
  model normalization (#3539); DashScope/Together fixtures.
- **Localized mode picker and composer indicators.** The `/mode` picker prompt,
  mode names, and hints, plus the composer's Vim mode indicator, now render in
  all seven shipped locales (model-facing mode labels stay English). Harvested
  from #2239 by @gordonlu.
- **Website and automation.** A runtime/integrations page, provenance and
  mirror-trust copy, a fact-drift CI gate, a published install script, and a
  weekly community digest archive on codewhale.net (#3419, #3421, #3415, #3482,
  #3420); per-automation mode/shell/trust/approval settings (#3467).
- **Model reference browser.** A read-only `/modeldb` command (aliases
  `model-reference`, `modelref`) opens a pager over the bundled catalog — every
  model's factual context window, max output, modality, and price, grouped by
  provider/kind. Labels only: it never selects, routes, or tiers a model
  (#3205, #2300).
- **Transcript presets.** A `/config preset <name> [--save]` mechanism with a
  first `calm` preset — calm mode, calm tool collapse, comfortable spacing, and
  low motion — presentation-only and evidence-preserving (#3478).
- **Model capability profiles.** A typed `model_profile` module separates
  intrinsic model facts from resolved provider-route capability, so compact
  routes defer heavier nonessential tools while standard/full routes keep the
  eager tool surface (#3451, #3365).
- **Live provider catalog refresh.** A secret-free `/models` live-fetch layer
  (401/403/404/429 mapped to typed outcomes) feeds the catalog cache; the API
  key authorizes the request but is never persisted into the delta or cache
  (#3385).

### Changed

- **Config modularization (#3311).** `ProviderKind` (#3505), harness posture
  (#3507), and provider default seeds (#3503) moved into dedicated modules, and
  the `config.rs` monolith split into clean leaf modules (paths, search,
  model/base-URL constants, sub-agent limits) behind a `pub use` facade.
  `AppMode` helpers were centralized (#3510), and mode-vs-permission policy is
  now derived through a single `base_policy_for_mode` resolver instead of
  scattered mutation (#3386, advisory review-intent behavior preserved).
- **Leaner tool surface.** Dropped `task_shell_*` from the active set and folded
  `tool_search_*` (#3463); ablated the in-turn loop_guard and encoded reasoning
  dispositions (#3462); added the Orchestration disposition to the constitution.
- **Routing.** Provider/model switches and the capability-aware fallback chain
  resolve through `RouteResolver`; reasoning effort is normalized for the
  *resolved* provider; the fallback chain now skips providers that lack auth
  (#2574); and context window and memory-pressure come from the resolved route
  (#3086).
- **UX.** Approval modal gained a group divider and selected-row caret (#3515);
  picker scroll/type-ahead and selection contrast hardened (#3500); the README
  was rewritten as an architecture end-cap (#3087); and repo agent guidance was
  de-hardcoded to live truth.
- **Fleet identity and defaults.** Fleet workers now enter with an explicit
  "summoned Fleet member" operating contract, setup/profile prompts keep the
  default model behavior as same-route inheritance, and generated worker
  instructions avoid leaking recursive topology that only the orchestrator
  needs.
- **Legacy swarm cleanup.** Removed the obsolete `/swarm` core command/menu
  registration so `/fleet` is the product surface, while `/subagents` remains a
  compatibility shortcut to worker status.
- **Running-state animation.** Tool cards and background-task rows now share one
  faster braille spinner cadence, so Bash/background work reads consistently
  alive across the transcript and sidebar.
- **Restored contributor credit.** Threaded machine-readable credit
  (`docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md` + `.github/AUTHOR_MAP`) for earlier merged work that
  shipped without it, including the `/jobs cancel-all` action and the npm
  retry-timeout hint (#1538) by @jieshu666, and the community ACP adapter
  reference by @rockeverm3m.

### Fixed

- **Release hygiene.** The strict `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked
  -- -D warnings` gate passes; `npm run build` no longer dirties the generated
  web facts; the site sets `metadataBase`; the community digest page parses each
  record independently and localizes its chrome; and `cargo audit` is clean with
  the starlark-transitive unmaintained advisories documented.
- **Routing and mode correctness.** Ordinary prompt text is no longer
  interpreted as a mode switch (#3387, #3491); model candidates are scoped to the
  active provider; Together-owned DeepSeek routes are accepted (#3426); insecure
  `http://` custom endpoints raise an advisory warning (#1519); and the Fleet
  setup planner's role/model selection now drives the generated profile.
- **Runtime stability.** MCP connection drops are explicit (#3524), HTTP API
  calls reuse a shared MCP pool (#3532), and per-agent sub-agent mailbox
  telemetry is throttled to cut UI lag (#3454).
- **YOLO background-shell approvals.** A background shell command no longer pops
  an approval modal in YOLO mode. `classify_risk` marks all shell commands
  destructive, so the auto-review safety floor held every *background* shell for
  review, and the `ForcePrompt` site never checked `auto_approve` — only
  background commands surfaced it, since foreground shells take the
  `Interactive` origin and skip that branch.
- **Bash approval modal fit.** The shell approval modal now labels Bash
  commands directly, avoids repeating command/workdir in the impact summary,
  wraps long commands, and switches to compact controls on short terminals so
  the decision keys stay visible.
- **Custom-provider picker rows.** Concrete `[providers.<name>]` entries now
  appear in the provider picker (id, endpoint, auth readiness, wire protocol,
  current model) instead of only the generic placeholder; auth readiness honors
  per-entry key/env/metadata/no-auth/loopback.
- **Passive MCP tool discovery.** Runtime API-owned stdio MCP processes are no
  longer spawned from passive `/v1/apps/mcp/tools` requests; live discovery
  remains available through `?connect=true`. `doctor` now warns on relative-path
  stdio MCP commands without `cwd`.

## [0.8.64] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Seamless auto-compaction defaults.** Known large-context routes now keep
  automatic compaction on by default while carrying summaries forward through
  the stable prompt path, reducing surprise context loss without changing
  explicit opt-out behavior.
- **Runtime web automation readiness.** Local app automation gains a
  loopback-only dev-server readiness primitive so agents can wait for TCP and
  optional HTTP health checks before browser verification. Harvested from
  #3376 by @cyq1017.
- **Model and integration polish.** `/model pro` and `/model flash` shortcuts
  now resolve to the current DeepSeek V4 routes while preserving existing model
  IDs. Harvested from #3350 by @KUK4. The WeCom bridge landed with
  maintainer follow-up hardening for state permissions and chat-facing error
  reporting, from #3370 by @pkeging.

### Fixed

- **Security and trust-boundary hardening.** Project-local config can no longer
  loosen user-owned shell or instruction-file policy, file edits now require a
  fresh read of the target file, git history inputs reject option-shaped or
  control-character revisions, interactive execution surfaces require approval,
  and local tool paths are narrowed through workspace/root validation.
- **Runtime and diagnostics redaction.** Generated runtime/app-server tokens,
  raw session lineage identifiers, provider registry drift values, review
  receipt internals, and webhook URLs are no longer echoed into human-facing
  logs or diagnostics.
- **Network and alert safety.** Provider TLS verification bypass requests now
  fail closed, fleet alert webhooks require HTTPS, fetch URL hostnames are
  resolved before requests, and runtime mobile auth no longer relies on
  token-bearing URLs.
- **Path-state hardening.** Config sibling files, project MCP cwd values,
  runtime thread store files, sub-agent state, project-local state roots, and
  app-server sidecar config paths now resolve through checked roots before
  reads/writes.
- **Release CI repair.** Nightly cross-target builds install Rust targets
  explicitly and retry transient cargo failures; auto-tag runs are serialized
  and treat an already-created remote tag as a no-op. Safe slices harvested
  from #3374 by @donglovejava.
- **Provider wait and sidebar regressions.** Provider-wait footers suppress
  noisy countdowns until useful while keeping timeout warnings visible,
  harvested from #3375 by @idling11. The pinned sidebar can render at a
  narrower 64-column boundary, harvested from #3371 by @donglovejava.
- **Delegated server cleanup.** Delegated `serve` / `app-server` children gain
  OS-level parent-death cleanup on supported platforms, completing the #3259
  follow-up from #3378 and #3317 by @wuisabel-gif.
- **ACP and sandbox correctness.** ACP sessions preserve multi-turn
  conversation history across prompt turns, harvested from #3372 by @xulongzhe.
  Worktree Git metadata writes are allowed through sandbox policy without
  broad trust-mode escalation, from #3356 by @cyq1017 and the #3355 report by
  @linletian.

### Changed

- **Community and dependency harvests.** The release train carries focused
  community-credit slices from #3379 by @greyfreedom, #3348 by @nightt5879,
  #3346 by @hongqitai, #3345/#3333 by @cyq1017, and Dependabot updates for
  `windows`, `toml`, `tokio`, `lru`, `similar`, and web tooling security locks.
- **Public release surface cleanup.** Benchmark-specific materials were kept
  out of the public release repo; benchmark source fragments belong in the
  separate `codewhale-bench` lane.

## [0.8.63] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Sub-agent fanout safeguards (#3318, #3319).** High-fanout Workflow runs can
  now queue and drain more agents than the instantaneous concurrency cap by
  default, with `[subagents] max_admitted` available to tune that bounded
  admission population. Distinct `agent` calls are no longer capped by the
  per-turn loop guard before runtime launch concurrency and provider
  rate-limit backoff can apply. `[subagents] token_budget` applies a shared
  aggregate token ceiling to a root `agent` run and its descendants.
- **Per-worker sub-agent token enforcement (#3321).** A `token_budget` /
  `max_tokens` set on an individual `agent` call now bounds that single worker
  mid-run: once its accumulated model tokens exceed the cap it stops cleanly
  with a `budget_exhausted` status instead of running to `max_steps`. This
  complements the scope-level admission gate (#3319) — the per-worker cap stops
  one runaway worker, the scope cap bounds total fan-out — without
  double-counting. Harvested from #3321 by @donglovejava.
- **Provider-specific sub-agent fanout config.** `[subagents.providers.<provider>]`
  profiles now override `enabled`, `max_concurrent`, `max_admitted`,
  `launch_concurrency`, `max_depth`, token budget, API timeout, and heartbeat
  timeout for the active provider. Use broad direct-API profiles such as
  `[subagents.providers.deepseek]` and tighter subscription profiles such as
  `[subagents.providers.glm]`; `/config subagents status` shows both global
  and active-provider resolved values.
- **Sub-agent control and isolation.** The single `agent` tool now exposes
  status, peek, and cancel actions for running children, and accepts
  `worktree: true` to create an isolated git worktree/branch for parallel edit
  lanes instead of requiring callers to hand-roll a `cwd`.

### Fixed

- **Mode and tool catalog correctness.** Core action tools remain discoverable
  in the model-facing catalog/tool search, and a consistency self-check flags
  registered handlers that drift out of the advertised catalog. Review-looking
  prompts in explicit Agent/YOLO mode now keep the requested mode and tools,
  with only an advisory review hint.
- **Sub-agent orchestration recovery.** Child agents now retry transient
  provider header/SSE timeouts before failing, and parent runs synthesize missed
  child completions from terminal child state so orchestration cannot hang on a
  lost completion event.
- **DeepSeek thinking tool calls.** DeepSeek chat-completions requests now omit
  explicit `tool_choice` whenever reasoning/thinking is enabled, avoiding
  provider rejections while leaving no-thinking routes unchanged.
- **Task sidebar shortcuts and attribution.** Ctrl-K stays palette/emacs-kill,
  while Ctrl-X is scoped to Tasks-sidebar background shell cancellation. Shell
  jobs launched by sub-agents now render with their child-agent owner in the
  Tasks sidebar and transcript.
- **Long-turn recovery and context economy.** Repeated read-only search
  loop blocks now return guidance instead of fatal tool failures, Python build
  failures that are missing `setuptools` include an install/retry hint, long
  foreground shell timeouts steer models toward background execution, and noisy
  shell/test/web outputs are compacted earlier for large-context routes.
- **Config display redaction.** `codew config get/list` now recursively masks
  token-, secret-, password-, credential-, and authorization-like keys inside
  unknown `extras` tables and redacts sensitive HTTP header values before
  printing config output.
- **Queued follow-up hints and force-steer keys.** The pending-input preview now
  advertises `Ctrl+S send now` whenever queued follow-ups exist, and
  Ctrl/Cmd+Enter force-steering also accepts the common Ctrl+J terminal
  encoding while a turn is running.
- **Sidebar default visibility restored (#3328).** New and upgraded sessions
  now use a pinned composed sidebar by default when the terminal is wide
  enough, so live Agents and Tasks surface without opting back into idle
  auto-collapse. Older settings files that captured the v0.8.62 auto-collapse
  default now migrate to `pinned` unless `/sidebar auto --save` records an
  explicit opt-in. `/sidebar` now reports when width or auto-collapse
  suppresses rendering instead of saying the sidebar is visible. Reported by
  @dxfq.
- **JavaScript execution proxy env handling (#3273, #3331).** `js_execution`
  now enables Node's environment-proxy mode when proxy variables are present,
  mirrors lowercase proxy variables for the child process, and backfills
  `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` from `ALL_PROXY`. Reported by @lordwedggie and
  harvested from #3331 by @cyq1017.
- **Legacy app-server non-loopback auth hardening (#3258).** Bare
  `codewhale app-server --host 0.0.0.0` now fails fast unless an explicit
  `--auth-token` or `CODEWHALE_APP_SERVER_TOKEN` is supplied, keeping generated
  one-time `cwapp_*` tokens loopback-only.
- **Legacy `.deepseek` state write-path migration (#3240).** State subdirectories
  (`sessions`, `slop_ledger`, `trophies`, `catalog`) are now always written under
  `~/.codewhale/`, and the first write of a subdir relocates any pre-existing
  `~/.deepseek/<sub>` contents into the primary location so the legacy tree stops
  growing while old data is preserved. The read resolver still finds legacy data
  for backfill until each subdir migrates. Reported by @Final527; onboarding
  marker slice from #3302 by @nightt5879.
- **State subdir validation on Windows (#3240).** State path hardening now
  rejects rooted/prefixed subdir strings such as `/etc` before resolving or
  migrating state directories, keeping the `.codewhale` write resolver inside
  its state root across platforms.

## [0.8.62] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **GLM-5.2 is now the default direct Z.AI model.** `DEFAULT_ZAI_MODEL` resolves
  to `GLM-5.2` in both `codewhale-tui` and `codewhale-config`; the `glm-5.1`
  alias still resolves to `GLM-5.1` (the defaulting was decoupled from the alias
  arm so it no longer tracks the default). Docs and `config.example.toml` no
  longer describe GLM-5.2 as an opt-in preview.
- **GLM-5-Turbo registered as a real model** and wired as the faster/explore
  sub-agent sibling for the GLM family: a `GLM-5.2` parent routes
  faster/explore children to `GLM-5-Turbo` (direct Z.ai) and `z-ai/glm-5-turbo`
  (OpenRouter), instead of down to GLM-5.1. GLM-5.1 and GLM-5-Turbo themselves
  have no cheaper tier and keep children on the parent.
- **`type: "explore"` sub-agents default to `model_strength: "faster"`.** Bounded
  read-only lookup/search/status work now uses the cheaper same-family sibling
  automatically, unless an explicit `model` or `model_strength: "same"` is
  supplied. Non-explore roles keep the conservative `same` default.
- **GPT-5.5 / OpenAI Codex faster route stays on GPT-5.5** with reasoning
  resolved to `low` (the Codex Responses API has no true `off`, so the resolved
  effort is now honest `low` rather than `off` silently rewritten). No
  DeepSeek/GLM fallback is fabricated when no cheaper same-provider sibling
  exists. DeepSeek Pro→Flash routing and its no-thinking faster lane are
  unchanged.
- **Base prompt / delegate skill guidance** updated to encourage parallel
  read-only exploration (2-4 `type: "explore"` sub-agents) for broad repo,
  version, branch, release, and API-surface investigations, while keeping
  architecture, integration, and final verification in the parent. The
  delegate skill examples now use provider-neutral `model_strength` instead of
  hardcoded DeepSeek model ids.
- **Agent synthesis guardrails.** The base constitution now frames tools around
  sufficient evidence rather than open-ended persistence: extra reads, searches,
  and delegation must target a missing fact, and agents should answer with
  limits instead of broadening searches indefinitely. The runtime loop guard
  now blocks duplicate read-only/delegated calls earlier and caps repeated
  broad lookup/delegation loops in a single turn with a synthesis-forcing tool
  error. Guard metadata distinguishes exact duplicates
  (`identical_tool_call`) from no-progress loops (`no_progress_tool_loop`).
- **Sub-agent handoff and visibility.** Direct sub-agent completions are drained
  before the next parent model request, so finished children can wake the main
  model promptly instead of waiting for an empty-tool-use branch or idle engine
  path. Nested sub-agents now report completions to their immediate parent
  inbox; the main model still receives only direct-child completions, avoiding
  grandchild floods while preserving nested evidence flow. Sub-agent output
  guidance now requires child-agent provenance when a sub-agent relies on a
  child report: cite the child `agent_id` and the child's EVIDENCE line(s), and
  do not present child findings as directly verified facts. The sidebar orders
  sub-agents as a parent/child tree and annotates nested rows with parent and
  depth information in hover text.
- **Sub-agent summary provenance (#2652).** A sub-agent's free-text result is now
  explicitly treated as an unverified self-report rather than confirmed
  evidence. The completion sentinel carries `summary_kind: complete | truncated`
  so the parent model can branch on whether it saw the full report or a clipped
  excerpt. Short summaries (≤ 12,000 chars) get a soft "re-verify material
  claims" suffix; longer ones are head+tail truncated with an honest marker
  stating the elided middle is not retrievable via `retrieve_tool_result`.
  Every summary therefore carries exactly one boundary marker, never both.
- **Provider metadata centralization.** Provider env vars, config keys, aliases,
  and auth hints are now resolved through the shared `ProviderMetadata` registry
  across `codewhale-config`, `codewhale-tui`, and `codewhale-cli`, reducing drift
  between the provider picker, `codewhale auth`, `doctor --json`, and setup
  hints.

### Added

- **Agent clarification questions (#3102).** Agents now have a first-class
  `request_user_input` tool to ask the user structured clarifying questions
  through a modal UI surface instead of only emitting a chat message and hoping
  the user notices. Mirrors the approval/secret-request flow the harness
  already used for permissions. The tool accepts 1-3 questions, each with a
  header, an id, 2-4 selectable options (label + description), and
  `allow_free_text` / `multi_select` flags (both default to `false` for
  back-compat). Input is validated up front with actionable errors. Wired
  across all layers: the `request_user_input` tool, engine handling
  (`turn_loop` → `approval`), an interactive TUI modal (`UserInputView`) with
  full keyboard navigation, and the runtime protocol
  (`EventFrame::UserInputRequest` + `AppRequest::SubmitUserInput`) so headless
  / app-server clients can answer programmatically. Parity tests cover the
  wire round-trip and the omitted-flags default.
- **Transcript hyperlinks — out-of-band OSC 8 (#3029).** Clickable file /
  file:line / URL links now reach the terminal through a column-drift-safe
  path. Link payloads are embedded in-band by the markdown renderer, then
  extracted out of the ratatui buffer cells and re-emitted out-of-band by
  `ColorCompatBackend` — so the `ESC` bytes never occupy display columns or
  corrupt selection. Supporting terminals get live hyperlinks; others see the
  label text unchanged. Clipboard/selection extraction strips residual codes as
  defense-in-depth.
- **CodeWhale-only skill discovery gate (#3296).** New
  `[skills].scan_codewhale_only = true` limits session-time skill discovery to
  CodeWhale-owned roots (`<workspace>/.codewhale/skills`, `~/.codewhale/skills`,
  and any explicit `skills_dir`) while ignoring cross-tool directories such as
  `.claude/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, and `~/.agents/skills`.
  The default remains the broad compatibility scan.
- **Permission/ask runtime rules (#3295).** Sibling `permissions.toml` ask-only
  rules are now loaded by the TUI engine and applied to `exec_shell` before
  Auto/session approval shortcuts. Matching ask rules force an approval prompt
  in otherwise auto-approved flows and are rejected under
  `approval_mode = "never"`.
- **Runtime API no-auth documentation.** `docs/RUNTIME_API.md` now documents
  `codewhale app-server --insecure-no-auth` for loopback-only testing and warns
  against combining it with `--mobile` on `0.0.0.0`.

### Fixed

- **TUI polish.** The empty-startup welcome block is centered by the actual
  rendered text width, fixing the off-center layout left over from the old
  sidebar-oriented welcome composition. Streaming HTTP body read errors now
  explain whether CodeWhale can retry before output, or is surfacing a warning
  after partial output to avoid replaying and duplicating streamed text.
- **Config comment preservation.** Rewriting `config.toml`, `settings.toml`, or
  `tui.toml` now merges user comments and formatting back into the serialized
  document; if comment merge fails, the write falls back to plain serialized
  output rather than failing.
- **Snapshot gate respected for per-tool snapshots (#3292).** Per-tool snapshots
  now check `[snapshots].enabled` before writing, matching the existing
  session-level gate.
- **Poppler `pdftotext` detection (#1667).** The dependency resolver now probes
  `pdftotext -v` instead of `--version`, because Poppler treats `--version` as
  an input filename. Fixes detection on systems where only Poppler is installed.
- **Plan confirmation checklist visibility.** The Plan-mode confirmation modal
  now shows the active checklist under the plan details, so users can review the
  concrete `checklist_write` work breakdown before accepting or revising a plan.

## [0.8.61] - 2026-06-15

This release lands the **runtime control plane** for multi-agent work: the TUI stays
responsive while sub-agents run, sub-agents converge toward fleet-style durable workers
with per-role model routing, and provider/model routes are isolated per session. It also
folds in several community contributions.

### Added

- **WhaleFlow runtime foundations** — worker runtime profiles (role / permissions / shell /
  tools / model-route, with non-escalating child derivation), a cross-provider model registry
  with offline catalog hydration, and provider-readiness / context-budget / provider-adapter /
  resource-telemetry services. (#3217, #3071, #3072, #3073)
- **Per-role, heterogeneous-model sub-agent routing** — sub-agents can be assigned a model and
  provider per role (e.g. scout vs. synthesis; verifiers route to a fast model). (#2027, #1768)
- **Durable goal mode** — cross-turn goal progress with token/time accounting and a
  verifier-as-judge gate before a goal may complete. (#3215, #891, #1976, #2058, #2029)
- Parent-visible worker interaction contract — a recommended action per worker. (#3226)
- Maintainer GitHub workflow skills; ACP registry submission prepared. (#3192)
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint on the legacy app-server HTTP transport,
  provider-neutral, with model registry resolution and configured-credential forwarding.

### Changed

- **Sub-agents converge toward fleet-style durable workers** — real worker lifecycle states are
  projected to the sidebar instead of a hardcoded "running", and a sub-agent returns a structured
  needs-input checkpoint instead of parking. (#3226, #3096, #3154)
- The per-turn runtime tag exposes capability posture instead of human-facing mode labels. (#3213)
- Independent shell and verifier work defaults to background jobs with nonblocking waits and a
  completion notification; blocking now requires an explicit wait. (#3212)
- Sub-agent launches now expose explicit `model_strength` and `thinking` controls to the model
  instead of hidden child-model auto-routing; `explore` work is documented as a good fit for
  faster models and `thinking: "off"`.
- Plan mode is strictly read-only (no shell tools), consistent with its runtime posture.
- `/swarm` is gated behind the durable worker substrate. (#3218)
- Legacy `deepseek` install/update path resolves to `codewhale`. (#2960, #2924, #2917)

### Fixed

- **TUI freeze when multiple sub-agents spawn (launch blocker)** — the terminal input pump runs
  off the render thread, AgentProgress events are coalesced, and sub-agents no longer park on
  input with no orchestrator to answer; a six-worker stress test guards input/render/cancel
  liveness. (#3216, #3096)
- Idle sub-agent completion notifications now resume the parent turn instead of waiting for a
  later user message; thanks @giovanni-paolilla for the deadlock report (#3266).
- **Provider/model route isolation** — provider and model state is session-local, and a
  mismatched provider+model tuple is rejected at the route boundary. (#3227)
- Route-effective context-window metadata, over-limit preflight, and bounded recovery from
  `context_length_exceeded` instead of re-looping. (#3204)
- Synchronous tools (`file_search`, `grep_files`, `list_dir`) are cancellable and no longer hold
  a turn open against cancellation. (#1791)
- MCP stdio proxy startup prompts no longer strand YOLO / non-interactive runs. (#2475)
- Stalled / failed background-shell recovery; configurable sub-agent API timeout. (#1737, #1786, #1806)
- Composer: reliable queued steering + Ctrl+S send (#3203, #3224); footer busy/idle indicator
  (#2982); CJK word-wrap (#963); clickable sidebar stop targets (#3028); live token throughput
  (#3190); auto-expiring terminal sub-agent cards (#3078).
- Linux glibc preflight in the installer/update path with a clear error. (#3207, #1067)
- Self-update retries transient GitHub metadata/asset failures and falls back from the GitHub
  REST API to the public `releases/latest` redirect before constructing release asset URLs. (#3232)
- Provider picker lists providers in neutral alphabetical order instead of hard-coding DeepSeek first; the active provider stays pre-selected. (#3076)
- Work sidebar no longer shows stale `phase now:` / `phase next:` strategy rows once the checklist
  is 100% complete.
- Plan mode no longer shortcuts investigation for requests that name a repository, URL, version,
  release, build state, bug, PR, issue, API surface, or local code path.
- Oversized pasted text stays editable in the composer, with a file backup appended at submit
  time for model access; thanks @idling11 (#3267, closes #3263).
- Bare digit keys `1`-`8` now insert text instead of firing hotbar slots; use `Alt+digit` for
  hotbar actions. Thanks @wjq2026 for the report and @DieMoe233 for the paste-path note (#3243).
- Kimi/Moonshot tool schemas normalize empty function parameters to a root object schema; thanks
  @jghwwnq for the provider repro (#3265).
- Novita defaults to its OpenAI-compatible `/openai/v1` endpoint so chat completions no longer
  404 out of the box; thanks @buko for the report and endpoint verification (#3255).
- Dependency security: `ws` pinned to 8.21.0 across npm packages to close remote memory-exhaustion
  DoS (dependabot).

## [0.8.60] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Agent Fleet real-run cutover (#3154/#3096).** `codewhale fleet run` now
  launches durable workers through the headless `codewhale exec --output-format
  stream-json` path instead of the local simulation interpreter, with terminal
  worker events freeing leases so queued fleet tasks continue running.
- **Read-only shell parallelism (#2983).** The engine can now run conservative
  read-only shell calls in parallel, including strict `bash`/`sh`/`zsh -c`
  wrappers for whitelisted commands, while writes, stdin, background TTY work,
  redirects, pipes, command substitution, and follow-mode tails stay serial.
- **Declarative JS/TS WhaleFlow authoring (#3097).** WhaleFlow now accepts a
  compile-only `workflow({...})` JavaScript/TypeScript authoring form that
  lowers into the existing `WorkflowSpec` validator without executing user
  JavaScript.
- **Slash-menu Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N navigation (#3196).** The slash command menu now
  supports Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N movement without letting the global file picker steal
  focus while the menu is open. Thanks @1Git2Clone for the PR.
- **New models and first-party provider routes.** This release adds
  **GLM-5.2** (selectable on the Z.ai Coding Plan and over OpenRouter as
  `z-ai/glm-5.2`, alongside the existing GLM-5.1 default), a first-party
  **Z.ai** provider route, a first-party **StepFun / StepFlash** route
  (`step-3.7-flash`), and a first-party **MiniMax** route defaulting to
  `MiniMax-M3` with the M2.7/M2.5/M2.1 family selectable (#3187/#3191).

### Changed

- **README and contributor credits.** The README now has a shorter public
  overview and moves the full contributor ledger to `docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md`,
  preserving public thanks for [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai),
  [DataWhale](https://github.com/datawhalechina),
  [OpenWarp](https://github.com/zerx-lab/warp), and
  [Open Design](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design).
- **Fleet-backed sub-agent direction.** Runtime docs now state the intended
  cutover clearly: "sub-agent" is role/UX vocabulary, while durable detached
  work should converge on the fleet-backed worker lifecycle with retries,
  receipts, and ledgered inspection.

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent eval no longer blocks by default.** `agent_eval` now returns the
  current projection immediately and delivers follow-up input without waiting
  for a running child to finish its provider call. Pass `block:true` for an
  intentional terminal wait.
- **Z.ai GLM thinking traces.** Direct Z.ai requests now use the documented
  `thinking` shape, preserve and replay `reasoning_content`, classify GLM
  reasoning streams as thinking output, and accept `ultracode` as a max-effort
  alias.
- **Claude skill archive compatibility (#2743).** `/skill install` keeps
  portable Claude-style skill folders supported while rejecting multi-skill
  Claude plugin archives clearly instead of silently installing only one skill
  and dropping plugin semantics. Thanks @AiurArtanis for the ecosystem request.

## [0.8.59] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Moonshot Kimi K2.7 Code model.** The Moonshot/Kimi provider now defaults to
  `kimi-k2.7-code`, recognizes `kimi`/`kimi-k2` aliases for that model, keeps
  explicit `kimi-k2.6` selectable, and adds the OpenRouter
  `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` registry row.
- **Concise verbosity mode (#3052).** CLI noninteractive launches now default
  to concise prompt/output discipline unless overridden by config, env, or
  `--verbosity`, while interactive TUI launches remain normal by default.
  Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **Ephemeral generated project context (#3058).** Opening CodeWhale in a
  directory with no instruction files now keeps the bounded generated project
  overview in memory instead of creating `.codewhale/instructions.md`.
- **ACP registry auth metadata (#1447).** The ACP stdio adapter now advertises
  terminal authentication setup in `initialize.authMethods`, matching the
  registry's validation requirement.
- **Sidebar context menus (#3065).** Right-clicking the sidebar no longer shows
  `Paste`; clickable sidebar rows now offer their row command as the first
  context action.
- **Sidebar hover popovers (#3088).** Streaming turns now keep sidebar hover
  popovers responsive while continuing to throttle transcript/body mouse
  motion.
- **Dark-theme selection contrast (#3074, thanks @drpars).** Session, config,
  help, context-menu, and approval selections now use the muted selection
  background instead of the bright accent color.
- **Cursor-style activity metadata rows (#3146).** Dense successful tool-run
  summaries now render as a single muted `Explored ...` / `Updated metadata`
  row, include short command-family labels for successful generic verifier
  groups, and keep keyboard/mouse expansion and detail inspection intact.
- **Provider-wait observability (#3095).** Footer stall reasons now name the
  active provider/model route, idle seconds vs stream budget, and whether a
  fanout plan is still at `0 running` or dispatch is pending. Structured
  provider-wait incidents log once per turn from the main tick loop (not on
  every footer redraw).
- **Interactive fanout launch gate (#3095).** Direct sub-agent children queue
  behind a configurable semaphore (`[subagents] interactive_max_launch`,
  default 4) with a visible `queued: waiting for an interactive fanout slot`
  reason before their first model step.
- **Goal lifecycle controls.** `/goal` is now the primary command surface for
  session goals, with `pause`, `resume`, `complete`, `blocked`, and `clear`
  controls while `/hunt` remains a compatibility alias.
- **Persistent thread-goal API.** App-server clients can now set, get, and clear
  durable thread goals through `thread/goal/set`, `thread/goal/get`, and
  `thread/goal/clear`, backed by the state store with Codex-style status and
  token/time accounting fields.
- **Command-boundary ownership layers (#2888/#3055).** Built-in slash command
  metadata now lives in `commands/registry.rs`, slash parsing in
  `commands/parse.rs`, and handlers under group-owned command areas, preserving
  the existing dispatch surface while reducing future `commands/mod.rs` churn.
- **Approval-rule source metadata (#1186/#2971).** Runtime API
  `approval.required` events now include optional `matched_rule` metadata when
  an execution-policy rule caused the prompt. Thanks @greyfreedom for the PR
  and @Ram9199 for the audit-semantics discussion.
- **Localized tool-family labels (#2901).** Tool activity labels for read,
  patch, run, find, delegate, fanout, RLM, verify, think, and generic tool
  work now route through the shipped locale tables. Thanks @gordonlu for the
  PR.
- **Localized config section labels (#2918).** The interactive config view now
  localizes section and session/saved scope labels while preserving English
  search terms. Thanks @gordonlu for the PR.
- **Localized config editor labels (#2919).** The config editor modal now
  localizes edit labels, default/unavailable placeholders, and effective
  currency hints. Thanks @gordonlu for the PR.
- **Hotbar number-key dispatch (#3056).** Bare `1`-`8` now trigger bound
  hotbar slots only when the composer is empty, while `Alt+1`-`Alt+8` trigger
  slots regardless of composer text and overlays keep key ownership. Thanks
  @reidliu41 for the PR.
- **Voice dictation commands (#3051).** `/voice`, `/voice-send`, and
  `/voice-control` now record through `sox`/`rec`/`arecord`, transcribe via the
  active provider's chat-completions API, and insert transcripts at the
  composer cursor. The `voice.toggle` hotbar action dispatches the real voice
  command, with help and status text localized across all seven shipped
  locales. Thanks @huqiantao for the PR.
- **Thread rewind and snapshot restore API (#2808).** GUI clients can now call
  `POST /v1/threads/{id}/undo`, `/patch-undo`, and `/retry` to fork, roll back,
  or rerun recent thread turns, plus `POST /v1/snapshots/{id}/restore` to
  restore a workspace snapshot by id. Thanks @bengao168 for the PR.
- **Active provider fallback chain (#2773).** Configured `fallback_providers`
  now build an ordered primary-plus-fallback route that the TUI can report,
  advance through, and reset with `/provider fallback reset`, including footer
  visibility for fallback state. Thanks @idling11 for the PR.
- **Provider metadata registry (#3005).** Built-in provider ids, display names,
  defaults, env vars, config keys, aliases, and wire formats now live in a
  shared metadata registry, with the provider drift check covering the registry
  contract. Thanks @sximelon for the PR.
- **Hugging Face provider route (#2879).** Hugging Face Inference Providers now
  have first-class config, env, docs, and registry coverage for the
  OpenAI-compatible router, including `huggingface`/`hugging-face`/
  `hugging_face`/`hf` aliases and `HUGGINGFACE_*`/`HF_*` env fallbacks. Thanks
  @mvanhorn for the PR.

### Fixed

- **SSE data lines without spaces (#3152).** Chat Completions, Responses, and
  Anthropic stream readers now accept both `data: {...}` and `data:{...}` SSE
  frames, matching the spec and preventing providers that omit the optional
  space from streaming empty output. Thanks @wgeeker for the PR.
- **Runtime thread detail N+1 reads (#3141).** `get_thread_detail` now scans
  persisted turn items once and groups them by turn instead of reading the
  items directory once per turn, preserving item order while keeping large
  thread detail loads responsive.
- **Project-local hook trust boundary (#3140).** `.codewhale/hooks.toml` is now
  loaded only after the workspace is trusted in user-owned config, matching the
  project-local MCP trust model while preserving the documented shell-command
  hook contract.
- **Skill registry sync latency (#3139).** `/skills sync` now syncs registry
  entries with bounded ordered concurrency, so network latency no longer stacks
  one skill at a time while output order stays deterministic.
- **SiliconFlow China provider config (#2893/#2895).** `siliconflow-CN`
  now reads its own `[providers.siliconflow_cn]` / `[providers.siliconflow-CN]`
  table and falls back to `[providers.siliconflow]` only for unset
  `api_key`/`base_url`/`model` fields. Thanks @Artenx for the report and
  @idling11 for the PR.
- **Self-update download timeout (#3006).** `codewhale update` now applies a
  five-minute HTTP client timeout so blocked or very slow GitHub release
  downloads fail instead of hanging indefinitely. Thanks @New2Niu for the PR.
- **Legacy `deepseek` update migration (#2960/#3013/#3053).** Running
  `deepseek update` or `deepseek-tui update` from a pre-rebrand install now
  returns copy-pasteable npm, Cargo, Homebrew, and manual-binary migration
  steps instead of trying to spawn a missing `codewhale` binary. README and
  rebrand docs now cover the same upgrade path. Thanks @jazzi and
  @tiangangQiu for the reports, @cyq1017 for the update-path PR, and
  @angus-guo for the README PR.
- **Short `codew` shim delegation.** The `codew` convenience binary now
  prefers the sibling `codewhale` dispatcher installed next to it before
  falling back to `PATH`, preventing fresh local builds or installs from
  accidentally invoking an older global dispatcher.
- **Constitution trust wording (#2950/#3008).** The base prompt now explains
  that "begins with an A" means a baseline of trust, not a literal output
  formatting rule. Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **TUI provider-source recovery (#3007/#3011).** Unsupported interactive
  providers now report whether the value came from `--provider`, environment,
  or config. Config-sourced unsupported providers fall back to DeepSeek without
  forwarding stale keyring secrets. Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **Exec auto-model handoff (#3148).** `codewhale exec --model auto` now
  survives the CLI/TUI boundary by honoring the CodeWhale model env alias and
  legacy DeepSeek model handoff before falling back to provider defaults.
  Thanks @hongchen1993 for the PR.
- **macOS shortcut modifiers (#2938/#2943).** Ctrl-like shortcuts that are
  reported as `SUPER` by macOS terminals now work for backgrounding tasks and
  sidebar-focus chords without rewriting clipboard shortcuts. Thanks @idling11
  for the PR.
- **TUI mouse-report leak (#3063/#3067).** Strip raw SGR mouse coordinate
  tails from the composer even when `use_mouse_capture` is false, covering
  orphaned terminal reporting state after crashes or focus races.
- **Interrupted sub-agent lifecycle (#3080).** API-timeout interruptions now
  emit `MailboxMessage::Interrupted`, render terminal interrupted cards, and
  reconcile stale running fanout counts from manager snapshots.
- **OpenAI Codex stream diagnostics and active tool collapse (#3146).** The
  Responses bridge now reports nested `response.failed` /
  `response.incomplete` errors instead of `unknown`, and dense successful
  in-flight tool bursts collapse into the same calm activity metadata row as
  committed history.
- **OpenAI Codex reasoning tiers.** Switching from DeepSeek to `openai-codex`
  now normalizes stale reasoning state into Responses-compatible
  `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` tiers. Startup, `/config`, and the model
  picker now display Codex labels instead of leaking DeepSeek
  `off`/`max` names, while Codex still reports as a Responses payload
  provider. The Responses request builder also clamps legacy `minimal` input
  to `low` and has regression coverage that Codex requests use
  `reasoning.effort`, not DeepSeek `thinking` fields.
- **OpenAI Codex context metadata (#3070).** The `gpt-5.5` default and
  CodeWhale aliases now use OpenAI's documented 1,050,000-token context window
  and 128,000 max-output metadata for context pressure, prompts, and doctor
  capability output.
- **OpenAI Codex effective context budgeting.** The public OpenAI API metadata
  for `gpt-5.5` remains 1,050,000 tokens, but the `openai-codex` OAuth route now
  budgets prompts against the 400K Codex-family effective window so preflight
  compaction runs before the backend returns `context_length_exceeded`.
- **OpenRouter Nemotron 3 Ultra preset.** The OpenRouter preset and model
  registry now emit `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` while keeping the old
  Ultra aliases compatible.
- **OpenRouter auth after MiMo switches (#3064).** Switching from Xiaomi MiMo
  to OpenRouter now has regression coverage for preflight key failures and
  Bearer auth header isolation before any request can be dispatched.
- **Responses strict-tool schema compatibility (#3062/#3017/#1883).** Responses
  function tools now preserve per-tool strict-mode compatibility, keep optional
  strict-schema fields nullable, and append deterministic constraint notes when
  root composition groups must be flattened for Responses.
- **Runtime prompt autonomous loop guard (#3061).** Runtime policy reference
  now explicitly forbids initiating new work when `<runtime_prompt>` is the
  only new turn content and no tool/sub-agent handoff is pending.
- **Goal runtime status sync.** Goal token budgets and active/paused/complete
  status now sync into the engine alongside the objective, and model-visible
  `update_goal` can only mark goals complete or blocked.

## [0.8.58] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Native Anthropic provider.** A dedicated Messages API adapter
  (`/v1/messages` with `x-api-key` auth) replaces OpenAI-dialect shims for
  Claude models: adaptive thinking with `output_config.effort` shaping,
  prompt-cache breakpoints (capped at 4, earliest dropped), signed-thinking
  replay via `signature_delta`, normalized cache-hit/miss usage telemetry,
  and SSE error envelopes. `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, and
  `claude-haiku-4-5` join the model registry; configure with
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (#3014).
- **Hooks v2.** `tool_call_before` hooks can now return a JSON decision —
  `{"decision": "allow"|"deny"|"ask", "reason", "updatedInput",
  "additionalContext"}` — with deny > ask > allow precedence across multiple
  hooks, last-writer-wins input rewriting, and concatenated context. Exit
  code 2 remains a legacy hard deny. Hooks support glob matchers and
  project-local `.codewhale/hooks.toml` (#3026).
- **Clickable sidebar.** Background-job rows show/cancel on click, the
  Ctrl+K hint row runs `/jobs cancel-all`, and agent rows open `/subagents`;
  row actions are built in the same pass as the rendered lines so a click
  can never target the wrong job (#3028).
- OSC 8 out-of-band hyperlink infrastructure with per-region open/close
  sequences that survive partial redraws (#3029).
- `codewhale exec` gains `--allowed-tools`, `--disallowed-tools` (deny wins),
  `--max-turns`, and `--append-system-prompt` (#3027).
- Constitution prompt source: YAML source-of-truth plus Python renderer for
  the system prompt, with the active prompt now served from
  `constitution.md` (#3015, renderer reconciliation still tracked).
- Agent-task issue template, labels, and runner protocol (#3021); remote
  smoke-test droplet loop hardening — gh CLI, swapfile, agent sessions
  (#3022).

### Changed

- **Sub-agent routing is provider-aware.** DeepSeek ids are no longer
  hardcoded into model validation; routing works from per-provider
  big/cheap candidates, the network router is skipped when a provider has
  no cheap tier, and spawn-time model requests are validated against the
  active provider (#3018).
- Model-specific facts in the system prompt (context window, sub-agent
  pricing, thinking notes, architecture characteristics) are now templated
  per-model instead of hardcoded DeepSeek V4 claims, in both `base.md` and
  `constitution.md` (#3025).
- Provider capability lookups for Moonshot/OpenAI/Atlascloud resolve from
  per-model registry rows (bare and vendor-prefixed ids) instead of
  hardcoded 64K-era floors (#3023).
- Reasoning-effort now reaches Atlascloud (DeepSeek dialect), Moonshot
  (`thinking` enable/disable), and Ollama (`think` param) (#3024); Moonshot/
  Kimi models joined the reasoning-content provider and model gates (#3016).
- Transcript polish: compact tool-call cells without boilerplate (#3031),
  internal turn/agent ids hidden behind stable labels (#3030), and Ctrl+B
  now backgrounds the running foreground shell directly instead of opening
  a menu (#3032).
- The Tasks sidebar separates "Model reasoning" from "Background commands",
  and `auth list` reports the same active-credential source as
  `auth status` for openai-codex.

### Fixed

- **TUI freeze under sub-agent load.** Rapid `AgentProgress` events
  saturated the render loop and starved terminal input; progress-driven
  repaints are now throttled to one per 100ms (#3033).
- **Hooks on Windows.** Hook commands were passed to `cmd /C` through
  CRT-style argument quoting, which injected literal `\"` sequences that
  cmd.exe never unescapes — JSON decisions could not parse. Commands now
  reach cmd.exe verbatim via `raw_arg`.
- Codex Responses: assistant tool results are converted to
  `function_call_output` items (multi-turn tool calling previously broke),
  tool schemas are sanitized for the Responses API, and `maximum` effort
  maps to `xhigh` (#3019, #3017 — both partially; retry/backoff and
  per-tool strict mode remain open).
- Better tool-denial and provider error messages harvested from PR #2933
  (#3020).


## [0.8.57] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Turns now survive system sleep.** When the host suspends mid-stream, the
  connection used to die on wake with `Stream read error: error decoding
  response body` and the turn was lost (#2990). The engine now stamps stream
  progress with both monotonic and wall-clock time; a large divergence on a
  stream error identifies a sleep/wake cycle, and the request is silently
  re-issued (up to the existing 3-retry budget) instead of failing the turn.
- **One-command release prep.** `./scripts/release/prepare-release.sh X.Y.Z`
  bumps the workspace version, every internal crate dependency pin, the npm
  wrapper, and the README install-tag examples, refreshes `Cargo.lock`,
  regenerates the embedded TUI changelog slice and web facts, and runs
  `check-versions.sh` — the v0.8.56 release needed nine follow-up commits for
  exactly these sync points.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` and `.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly cargo +
  github-actions updates, monthly npm for `web/`).

### Changed

- **The changelog went on a diet.** Root `CHANGELOG.md` now carries recent
  releases (v0.8.40+); older entries moved to `docs/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
  `crates/tui/CHANGELOG.md` — embedded into every binary for `/change` — is a
  generated 15-release slice (`scripts/sync-changelog.sh`), no longer a
  357 KB manual byte-for-byte copy (~300 KB smaller binaries).
- GitHub Release bodies are generated from the tagged version's changelog
  section (`scripts/release/generate-release-body.sh`) instead of a
  hardcoded workflow blob with a hand-pasted contributor list.
- `check-versions.sh` now also gates `web/lib/facts.generated.ts` and the
  README install-tag examples; the CNB mirror pipeline validates the pushed
  tag against `Cargo.toml` before generating release notes.
- Docs reorganized: internal design notes moved under `docs/rfcs/`; stale
  internal docs (old audits, handoffs, region-specific VM notes) removed.
- Agent-facing polish: the system prompt environment block reports
  `codewhale_version` (was `deepseek_version`), the legacy
  `.deepseek/instructions.md` path is no longer advertised in the prompt
  (still honored for back-compat), and oversized instruction files are
  truncated with an explicit `[…truncated: N bytes omitted]` marker instead
  of a bare ellipsis.

### Fixed

- **Docker images build again.** The release `docker` job failed for v0.8.56
  because the Dockerfile still copied the pre-rebrand `deepseek` /
  `deepseek-tui` binaries; they are now symlinks to the codewhale binaries
  inside the image, so legacy container entrypoints keep working.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` used the pre-rebrand container name,
  mount path, and `deepseek` remote user.
- Stale `--bin deepseek` examples, `DeepSeek-TUI` strings in `/change`
  output, and pre-rebrand doc comments.

### Removed

- Unused dependencies: `tracing-appender` and `zeroize` (TUI crate),
  `rustls` (release crate); the orphaned `vendor/schemaui-0.12.0` lockfile
  leftover and a machine-specific one-off `scripts/verify_task.sh`.

## [0.8.56] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Status picker localization.** The status picker surface (7 MessageIds) is
  now localized across all supported locales (#2896, @gordonlu).
- **Approval dialog localization.** The approval dialog surface is now
  localized across 7 locales: English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese,
  Vietnamese, Portuguese, Spanish, and French (#2891, @gordonlu).
- **Volcengine provider in TUI dispatcher.** The `codewhale` / `codewhale-tui`
  CLI dispatcher now allows the Volcengine provider, so users can launch
  directly into a Volcengine-backed session (#2923, @hongchen1993).
- **Dispatcher API-key preference.** When a provider-specific API key is
  supplied via the CLI dispatcher, it is now preferred over the saved root
  key, fixing a regression where saved keys masked explicit CLI keys (#2928,
  @hongchen1993).
- **Qwen 3.6 Plus model support.** Added complete Qwen 3.6 Plus model
  resolution with dedicated version-bump tests (#2930, @idling11).
- **Oversized paste spill.** Pastes larger than ~10 KB are now written to
  `.codewhale/pastes/` instead of being truncated or dropped, preserving the
  full content for the session (#2920, @sximelon).
- **Cross-session prompt cache.** Added a disk-backed cross-session prompt
  base-section cache so post-mode-flip and post-restart turns reuse the
  byte-stable prefix without rebuilding it from scratch.

### Fixed

- **Background shell routing.** Shell commands expected to take >5 seconds are
  now automatically guided to background tasks instead of blocking the agent
  loop, with the task panel syncing immediately on cancel (#2947, #2941,
  @cyq1017, @idling11).
- **`allow_shell` error naming.** Shell-tool refusal errors now explicitly name
  `allow_shell = false` as the reason and suggest `/config allow_shell true` as
  the escape hatch (#2905, @cyq1017).
- **Prefix-cache stability across mode flips.** `allow_shell` is now decoupled
  from the static system-prompt prefix, so mode changes (Plan ↔ Agent ↔ YOLO)
  no longer rebuild the byte-stable message[0] and invalidate the DeepSeek
  prefix cache (#2949, @LeoAlex0).
- **`visibility="internal"` explained.** The Runtime Policy Reference section
  of the system prompt now explains the `visibility="internal"` attribute so
  models stop narrating their current mode between steps (#2951, @LeoAlex0).
- **Bocha web search response handling.** Updated response parsing for the
  Bocha search backend after an upstream API change (#2946, @h3c-hexin).
- **PDF read hang.** Full-PDF reads now use `extract_text_by_pages` to avoid
  a hang on large or complex PDFs (#2898, @idling11).
- **9 critical bugs.** Fixed bugs across tools, client, and commands: stale
  `ContentBlockStop` cleanup, missing `#[test]` attribute, trailing-space
  restoration on English `ApprovalField` labels, and several
  correctness/stability issues (#2880, @HUQIANTAO).

### Changed

- **CNB shim cleanup.** Removed deprecated `deepseek` shim references from the
  CNB mirror path.
- **Style.** Applied `cargo fmt` to `crates/tools/src/file.rs`.

## [0.8.55] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Together AI provider.** Added Together AI as a first-class provider
  (`[providers.together]`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`/`TOGETHER_BASE_URL`/`TOGETHER_MODEL`)
  with default models `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` and
  `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`, TUI provider-picker/auth/capability support,
  and CLI `auth list`/`auth status` coverage.
- **Model catalog updates.** Added Qwen 3.7 Max (`qwen/qwen3.7-max`), MiniMax 2.7
  (`minimax/minimax-m2.7`), and NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra (`nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra`)
  on OpenRouter.
- **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT) provider — experimental.** Added an `openai-codex`
  provider that reuses an existing ChatGPT/Codex CLI OAuth login. The access
  token is read and refreshed from `~/.codex/auth.json` (no API key is stored),
  and requests use the OpenAI Responses API at `/codex/responses` with the
  `chatgpt-account-id` header and `responses=experimental` beta opt-in. Env
  overrides: `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
  `OPENAI_CODEX_BASE_URL`/`CODEX_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_CODEX_MODEL`/`CODEX_MODEL`,
  `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`/`CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`, `OPENAI_CODEX_AUTH_FILE`,
  `CODEX_HOME`. Default model `gpt-5.5`. The live Responses round-trip has not
  been exercised against the production backend in CI; treat as preview.

## [0.8.54] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added `/restore list [N]` so users can inspect more side-git rollback
  snapshots with UTC timestamps before choosing a restore point. Plain
  `/restore` now shows the 20 most recent snapshots, numeric restore targets can
  reach beyond that default listing up to a bounded index, and list requests
  above the visible cap fail explicitly instead of silently truncating.
- Added HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony support scaffolding: environment-driven
  `OHOS_NATIVE_SDK` setup scripts and compiler wrappers, platform docs,
  explicit Rustls ring-provider installation for the no-provider TLS build, and
  OHOS fallbacks for unsupported keyring, clipboard, sandbox, browser-open, TTY,
  execpolicy Starlark parsing, and self-update surfaces.
- Added `scripts/release/check-ohos-deps.sh` and wired it into CI/release
  preflight so the OpenHarmony target graph fails if unsupported `nix`,
  `portable-pty`, `starlark`, `arboard`, or `keyring` dependencies re-enter.
- Added `.github/AUTHOR_MAP` and a CI co-author credit check so harvested
  commits use GitHub-mappable numeric noreply identities instead of `.local`,
  placeholder, bot/tool, or raw third-party emails.
- Added a `turn_end` observer hook that fires after post-turn TUI state and
  token totals are updated. Hooks receive structured JSON with status, usage,
  totals, duration, tool count, and queued-message count on stdin; stdout is
  ignored and failures are warn-only (#1364, #2578).
- Added provider-scoped `insecure_skip_tls_verify` for private
  OpenAI-compatible gateways that cannot use a trusted CA bundle. The setting is
  disabled by default, applies only to the active LLM provider HTTP client, and
  is surfaced by `codewhale doctor`; `SSL_CERT_FILE` remains the preferred path
  for corporate or private CA roots. Thanks @wavezhang for the original #1893
  direction.
- Added a default-disabled hard-compaction planner that can identify the
  summarizable middle of a long conversation while preserving the recent tail,
  existing tool-call/result pair guarantees, and working-set pinning. This
  harvests the safe planning layer from #2522 without enabling hard compaction
  or adding a message-rewrite execution path yet. Thanks @HUQIANTAO for the
  proposal.
- Added rich PlanArtifact support to `update_plan`: Plan mode can now carry
  grounded objectives, context, sources, critical files, constraints,
  verification, risks, and handoff notes through the transcript card, Plan
  confirmation prompt, `/relay`, fork-state, and saved-session replay.
- Added the first `codewhale-whaleflow` foundation crate with typed workflow
  config/IR validation and deterministic phase ordering tests. This preserves
  the WhaleFlow direction from #2482/#2486 without exposing a runtime
  `workflow_run` tool until cancellation, replay, and worktree semantics are
  release-safe. The foundation now includes explicit `WorkflowSpec`,
  `WorkflowNode`, branch/leaf/policy metadata structs, plus serializable branch,
  leaf, and control-node result records toward the #2668 TraceStore contract.
  It also adds a crate-local mock executor skeleton for Sequence, BranchSet,
  Leaf, Reduce, LoopUntil, Cond, Expand, BranchTournament, and ParetoFrontier
  control flow so #2669 can progress without spawning agents, applying
  worktrees, or exposing a `workflow_run` runtime tool yet. A first Starlark
  authoring layer now compiles fail-closed model-authored workflow files into
  that typed IR, with `rlm_cache_change.star` and `issue_fix_tournament.star`
  examples plus a one-pass repair for common `ctx.*` authoring aliases (#2670).
  Leaf, branch, and workflow execution results now carry deterministic token
  and cost telemetry fields that the mock executor can aggregate without live
  provider calls or runtime sub-agent fanout (#2486). The mock executor now
  carries crate-local cancellation and budget-exhaustion status markers so the
  branch/leaf runtime contract can be tested before live workflow execution is
  exposed (#2669). A crate-only replay executor now evaluates workflows from
  recorded leaf/control records, computes
  stable SHA-256 leaf input hashes, and marks missing records as
  `replay_diverged` instead of calling models again (#2673); the runtime replay
  command and live-provider replay fallback remain deferred. The crate also now
  has a model-agnostic role/capability registry with mock provider plumbing and
  fail-closed JSON repair parsing, so WhaleFlow can choose capable models for
  roles without hardcoding provider-specific runtime paths (#2672). The
  `rlm_cache_change.star` dogfood workflow now exercises candidate branches,
  LoopUntil verification, tournament selection, teacher review, and mock
  execution in CI-oriented crate tests (#2679). Leaf, branch, and workflow
  results now also carry separate ARMH/shared-memo and provider prompt-cache
  telemetry counters, with mock aggregation tests, so #2671 can progress
  without wiring live RLM calls or billing-affecting provider behavior yet. The
  Starlark and typed-IR gates now also reject unknown leaf dependencies,
  reducer inputs, and teacher-review candidates before mock execution or replay,
  keeping generated workflows fail-closed while runtime/worktree semantics stay
  deferred. TeacherReview now has serializable GEPA-style candidate artifacts
  for notes, workflow recipes, skills, regression tests, cache policy, branch
  heuristics, and Starlark authoring prompt patches, plus an offline helper
  that proposes candidates from recorded execution traces without promoting
  them or training model weights (#2674). StudentReplay results can now be
  stored on teacher candidates, and a deterministic PromotionGate compares
  baseline-vs-candidate replay deltas, required tests, policy violations,
  staleness, and cost constraints before marking a candidate promotable (#2675).
  The external-memory cutline now documents that Aleph-style memory stays
  optional, explicit, visible, and clear/export-capable for v0.9.0 rather than
  becoming a hidden default context substrate (#2677).
  A dedicated v0.9.0 release acceptance matrix now tracks provider, runtime,
  UI, WhaleFlow, Model Lab, remote-workbench, docs, rollback, and credit gates
  that must be checked or explicitly deferred before tagging (#2729).
  HarnessProfile docs now pin the v0.9.0 order: posture/schema/resolver/seed
  profiles/status display must precede evidence stores, promotion gates, or any
  automatic Harness Creator, with DeepSeek, MiMo, Arcee, and generic/HF/local
  posture expectations called out separately (#2728).
  Hugging Face / Model Lab and `codebase_search` release gates now explicitly
  ship only the provider/MCP/docs/design foundation in v0.9; native Hub search,
  model passports, Spaces/Jobs workflows, eval/export surfaces, and runtime
  `codebase_search` registration remain deferred (#2705, #2680, #2727).
  Remote workbench acceptance is also marked docs/setup-only for v0.9 so release
  notes do not imply a shipped VM or Telegram bridge runtime (#2724).
  Release-facing HarnessProfile docs now match the current implementation:
  v0.9 ships the typed schema/config foundation and defers runtime resolver,
  telemetry, seed-profile selection, and status-display behavior until later
  verified slices. `config.example.toml` includes a commented dormant
  harness-profile example, and README links point at the real acceptance matrix
  and HarnessProfile cutline docs.
  The release acceptance matrix now records evidence for already-landed gates:
  provider-registry drift checks, provider-scoped TLS skip verify, read-only
  GUI runtime/restore-point surfaces, VS Code Agent View branch visibility,
  WhaleFlow mock/runtime foundations, explicit external-memory boundaries, and
  docs alignment. Live workflow execution, provider calls, TraceStore writes,
  and mutation-oriented GUI endpoints remain deferred until their atomicity and
  replay contracts are tested. The `rlm_cache_change.star` dogfood workflow can
  now be replayed from recorded mock leaf/control records, and missing dogfood
  records produce `ReplayDiverged` instead of falling back to live execution
  (#2679). The UI/workflow UX rows now also distinguish shipped transcript
  tool-run collapse, sidebar detail popovers, and PlanArtifact review/handoff
  evidence from the deferred first-look/home redesign, and record focused
  slash-picker readability smoke coverage for visibility, selection, skill
  insertion, Esc priority, and stable composer height (#2692, #2694, #2691,
  #2713).
  Thanks @AdityaVG13 for the WhaleFlow draft and cost-tracking direction.
- Added a state-store v2 schema migration for WhaleFlow trace tables covering
  workflow, branch, leaf, control-node, and teacher-candidate runs. The
  migration creates persistence shape only; workflow execution and replay
  remain deferred until the runtime semantics are safe (#2668).
- Added an official VS Code extension Phase 0 scaffold with terminal launch,
  local runtime attach checks, status bar state, and a read-only Agent View
  preview backed by recent runtime thread summaries, plus a read-only
  `GET /v1/snapshots` endpoint for GUI clients to inspect side-git restore
  points. The extension now renders those restore points read-only in its Agent
  View, and thread summaries include read-only workspace, branch, current Git
  head, and dirty-state metadata so the VS Code Agent View can show when a
  thread or agent lane is on another branch or has changed worktree state. Agent
  View and restore-point data now auto-refresh on a configurable
  read-only interval so branch/workspace/status changes become visible without a
  manual refresh. Agent View refreshes keep thread branch/workspace rows
  independent from restore-point loading, so a snapshot-listing failure no
  longer clears already-available thread metadata. This answers the VS Code GUI
  lane without exposing chat webviews, inline edits, or retry/undo/restore
  runtime mutation endpoints yet
  (#461, #462, #480, #1217, #2341, #1584, #2327, #2580, #2808). Thanks @AiurArtanis
  for the Agent View prompt, @lbcheng888 for the earlier scaffold, @gaord for
  the GUI runtime API direction, @douglarek, @caeserchen, and @nightt5879 for
  the branch visibility trail, and @BigBenLabs, @lzx1545642258, @yangdaowan,
  @mangdehuang, @VerrPower, @hejia-v, @nasus9527, and @ygzhang-cn for the
  GUI/VS Code demand and validation trail.
- Added inline live-output refresh for background shell Exec cards keyed by the
  exact shell task id, so long-running commands can show bounded stdout/stderr
  tails without consuming deltas or matching by command text. Thanks
  @donglovejava for the live shell-output direction in #2048.
- Added a static prompt composer override for embedders that need to replace
  the byte-stable base/personality prompt segment while leaving mode metadata,
  approval policy, tool taxonomy, Context Management, and the Compaction Relay
  under CodeWhale's runtime prompt assembly. This refines the embedder prompt
  customization path from #2786 without weakening prompt-continuity safeguards.
  Thanks @h3c-hexin.
- Added `POST /v1/sessions` for runtime clients to save a completed thread as a
  managed session. The endpoint preserves thread title/model/mode/workspace
  metadata, maps missing threads to 404, and returns 409 instead of snapshotting
  queued or active turns.
- Added cost-estimate pricing for the Xiaomi MiMo primary chat models, which
  were previously unpriced: `mimo-v2.5-pro` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro` reuse the
  DeepSeek V4-Pro rate table and `mimo-v2.5` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` reuse the
  DeepSeek V4-Flash rates. Existing DeepSeek pricing is unchanged (#2731, #2750).
- Added a metadata-only `codewhale-config` provider registry with canonical
  lookup, alias-aware resolution, provider defaults, config-table keys, and
  API-key env candidates. Runtime routing remains unchanged and fallback
  providers stay dormant; this harvests the safe provider-trait foundation from
  #2479 toward #2075. Thanks @sximelon.
- Added optional `[search].base_url` / `CODEWHALE_SEARCH_BASE_URL` support for
  DuckDuckGo-compatible private search endpoints, while keeping
  `DEEPSEEK_SEARCH_BASE_URL` as a legacy alias. Custom endpoints are gated by
  their configured host, do not fall back to public Bing, and report the custom
  host as the result source for diagnostics (#2436, #2510).
- Added `completion_sound = "file"` with `[notifications].sound_file` so
  Windows users can play a custom WAV file for turn-completion sounds without
  changing the global Windows sound scheme (#2484, #2512).
- Added `[tui].stream_chunk_timeout_secs` and `/config stream_chunk_timeout_secs`
  so slow local or OpenAI-compatible model servers can extend the SSE idle
  timeout without mutating process environment. The legacy
  `DEEPSEEK_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` env var remains a fallback (#2365, #2507).
- Added dormant `fallback_providers = [...]` config parsing plus a provider-chain
  helper for future fallback routing. This preserves the requested contract
  without enabling silent runtime provider switches yet (#2574, #2777). Thanks
  @hsdbeebou for the request and @idling11 for the data-model draft.
- Added `/hf` with `/huggingface` alias for Hugging Face MCP status/setup
  helpers and `/hf concepts` provider/MCP/Hub guidance. The helper points users
  to Hugging Face's settings-generated MCP configuration and intentionally does
  not include Hub search, direct Hugging Face HTTP requests, or upload behavior
  (#2709, #2782). Thanks @idling11 for the original Hugging Face MCP draft.
- Added an in-process response cache for deterministic non-streaming,
  tool-free chat requests. The cache is keyed by provider, base URL, path
  suffix, API-key fingerprint, and final wire body, and zeroes usage on hits so
  local spend counters are not double-counted (#2501). Thanks @HUQIANTAO for
  the response-cache proposal and canonical-body key update.
- Added `/sidebar` so users can toggle, show, hide, and optionally persist the
  TUI sidebar from the command line instead of relying on copy-hostile sidebar
  state during long transcript work (#2766, #2788). Thanks @mo-vic for the
  detailed report and @aboimpinto for the fix.
- Added a pausable custom slash-command MVP: commands with `pausable: true`
  can pause before further tool execution, preserve the paused command while
  separate messages are handled, and resume only on explicit continue/resume
  wording. Harvested from #2732 with thanks to @aboimpinto.
- Added Sofya (`provider = "sofya"`) as a search-tool backend with
  `SOFYA_API_KEY` fallback, while keeping Sofya scoped to web search rather
  than model-provider routing (#2790). Thanks @yusufgurdogan for the
  implementation.
- Added Xiaomi MiMo `mode` / `XIAOMI_MIMO_MODE` / `MIMO_MODE` selection for
  Token Plan region endpoints and pay-as-you-go routing, plus dedicated Token
  Plan env keys for `tp-*` subscriptions (#2621, #2627). Thanks @springeye for
  the request and @xyuai for the implementation.
- Added the first TUI hotbar action registry foundation so future UI controls
  can dispatch typed app actions instead of growing another command match
  surface (#2866). Thanks @reidliu41 for the implementation.
- Added the narrow multi-tab core and persistence foundation, including tab
  manager snapshots, delegation/group restore counters, mention parsing,
  cross-tab events, and corruption-tolerant persisted state, while leaving the
  broader collaboration UI wiring to follow-up work (#2864). Thanks
  @ljm3790865 for the tab-core implementation and #2753 direction.
- The VS Code Agent View now renders the runtime thread summary's Git `head`
  and dirty-worktree flag alongside branch metadata, keeping branch switches
  visible without adding retry/undo/restore mutation endpoints yet (#2580,
  #2862). Thanks @AiurArtanis and @nasus9527 for the IDE/agent-view requests
  and @gaord for the runtime metadata direction.

### Changed

- Removed the deprecated `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary shims from the
  v0.9.0 Cargo crates and GitHub release artifact matrix. The canonical
  `codewhale`, `codew`, and `codewhale-tui` entry points remain, the private
  deprecated `npm/deepseek-tui` notice package stays unpublished, and DeepSeek
  provider/model/env/config compatibility remains first-class.
- Command-adjacent config persistence and auto model routing now live in
  neutral TUI modules instead of command-owned files, reducing command-boundary
  coupling while preserving current `/config`, `/model`, UI, runtime, and
  sub-agent behavior (#2871). Thanks @aboimpinto for landing this first staged
  command-boundary layer from the broader #2851/#2791 design direction.
- `/config` now reports the canonical `~/.codewhale/settings.toml` path for TUI
  settings while still reading legacy DeepSeek-branded settings fallbacks and
  migrating them into the CodeWhale home on load.
- Provider switches now roll back transactionally when the first request to a
  newly selected provider fails authentication: CodeWhale restores the previous
  provider/model, model-ID passthrough, onboarding/API-key state, runtime
  config, persisted provider selection, and engine handle so users can return
  to DeepSeek after a failed Moonshot/Kimi switch (#2754, #2755). Thanks
  @Dr3259 for the Windows repro and @cyq1017 for the draft fix.
- `PATCH /v1/threads/{id}` can now update a thread's persisted workspace for
  GUI/runtime clients. Workspace changes reject active turns and evict idle
  cached engines so the next turn starts in the new workspace.
- Split `web_run` session/page cache state so cached page reads use shared
  page handles and do not serialize through the mutation path. The harvest also
  adds panic-safe state write-back and serializes cache-mutating unit tests so
  the global web cache remains stable under normal Cargo test parallelism.
- Appended volatile `<turn_meta>` blocks after user text in outgoing user
  message content arrays so provider prefix caches can keep matching the stable
  user-input prefix across date, route, and working-set changes.
- Projected mode, approval, and tool-taxonomy prompt metadata per request
  instead of mutating stored system prompts, keeping provider prefix-cache
  inputs byte-stable while preserving mode-specific instructions (#2687).
  Thanks @LeoAlex0 for the implementation.
- Softened contribution intake automation: external issues now receive a warm
  triage note and are never auto-closed by the contribution gate, while the PR
  gate copy makes clear that dry-run observations are about maintainer safety,
  not contributor quality.
- Added a PR gate marker guard so reopened unapproved PRs do not get duplicate
  intake comments, and clarified that PR reopening should happen after
  allowlist approval is merged.
- Ollama `/model` completions no longer show hosted DeepSeek API model IDs.
  The picker preserves the current or saved local Ollama tag, and users can
  still fetch installed model IDs through `/models` instead of relying on a
  stale static default (#2742). Thanks @reidliu41 for the focused report and
  draft fix.
- MCP runtime API tool listings and approval summaries no longer split
  underscored MCP server names at the first `_`. Tool-call routing already used
  the longest registered server name; the list endpoint now reuses that parser,
  and approval cards show the full MCP target route instead of a guessed server
  segment (#2744). Thanks @lioryx, @cyq1017, and @puneetdixit200 for the report
  and matching fixes.
- Documented the agent and sub-agent stewardship ethos so future automation
  preserves human issue intake, careful PR review, and contributor credit.
- Moved the TUI Starlark execpolicy parser and PTY support behind non-OHOS
  target dependencies so published OpenHarmony builds no longer pull `nix` 0.28
  through `rustyline` or `portable-pty`.
- Explicit `skills_dir` configuration is now unioned with workspace skill
  discovery instead of being shadowed by workspace-local skills, and configured
  skills take precedence over global defaults when prompt space is constrained.
- Tool-agent sub-agent routing now inherits the parent session model, or an
  explicit tool-agent override, instead of hard-coding `deepseek-v4-flash`;
  the fast lane still disables thinking through provider-aware request shaping.
- Dense successful read/search/list tool runs now collapse into a single
  expandable transcript row by default, while running, failed, shell, patch,
  review, diff, and other risky tool cells remain visible. The setting
  `tool_collapse = "compact" | "expanded" | "calm"` controls the behavior.
- Pending-input preview rows now label delivery mode explicitly as steer
  pending, rejected steer, or queued follow-up, with wrapped continuation rows
  aligned under the label so busy-turn input state is easier to read (#2054).
- Editing a queued follow-up is now an explicit pending-input state. Pressing
  `Esc` while editing a queued follow-up restores the original queued message
  instead of cancelling the active turn or silently dropping the queued work
  (#2054).
- Approval prompts now render prominent command, directory, file, path, or
  target rows before falling back to raw JSON params. Shell approvals preserve
  long command tails, split common shell chains for review, and show compact
  `printf > file` previews while keeping intent summaries visible (#1991,
  #2269).
- Sidebar hover details now use row-level metadata for truncated Work, Tasks,
  and Agents rows. Mouse hover opens a bordered, wrapping popover with the full
  underlying row text, long turn/agent ids, and current sub-agent progress
  instead of repeating the already-ellipsized sidebar label (#2694, #2734).
- Sub-agents now preserve checkpoint metadata around long model calls. A
  per-step API timeout marks the child as interrupted with a continuable
  checkpoint instead of ending as a null failed result, and `agent_eval` can
  explicitly continue a live checkpointed interrupted child while normal
  completed/failed/cancelled follow-up behavior stays unchanged (#2029).
- Durable task recovery no longer requeues tasks that were `running` when the
  previous CodeWhale process exited. On restart those records are marked failed
  with a recovery note, and any running tool-call summaries are marked failed
  too, so stale shell/task state cannot silently become live work again (#1786).
- Auto-generated project instructions now reuse the bounded Project Context
  Pack data instead of running an unbounded summary/tree scan when no
  `.codewhale/instructions.md` file exists. The fallback keeps later
  top-level folders visible in noisy large workspaces while the dynamic
  `<project_context_pack>` marker remains controlled by its own setting
  (#697, #1827).
- Project context loading now uses a bounded process-local content-signature
  cache for repeated hot-path loads. The cache covers workspace/parent
  instructions, global AGENTS/WHALE fallbacks, repo constitution files,
  generated-context targets, trust markers, and trust config paths, and it
  stores post-load signatures so auto-generated context deletion/regeneration
  stays correct (#2636).
- Configuration docs now show the provider-local `path_suffix` escape hatch
  for OpenAI-compatible gateways that accept `/chat/completions` but reject
  `/v1/chat/completions`, while making clear that model listing and DeepSeek
  beta routes keep their built-in paths (#1874).
- The config crate now carries the v0.9 HarnessPosture data model:
  `HarnessPosture`, `HarnessProfile`, and typed posture/compaction/tool/safety
  enums. The schema rejects misspelled posture names or unknown profile keys
  instead of silently falling back to `custom`; a pure resolver can match
  provider/model routes for tests and future status plumbing, while runtime
  provider/model posture selection remains a follow-up (#2693, #2741, #2728).

### Fixed

- **MiMo default tests.** Guarded Xiaomi MiMo default-model tests against ambient CI provider environment variables.
- Stream/body decode failures such as `Stream read error: error decoding
  response body` are now classified as recoverable network interruptions
  instead of generic internal errors, keeping the transcript and triage metadata
  aligned with the existing stream retry path (#2847). Thanks
  @qamranmushtaq-collab for the Windows/npx DeepSeek report.
- The TUI footer, `/status`, `/mcp` manager, and command-palette MCP entries
  now count trusted workspace-local `.codewhale/mcp.json` servers together with
  the global MCP config, matching `codewhale mcp list` for merged global +
  project setups (#2787). Thanks @yekern for the detailed reproduction.
- AltGr key chords in the composer no longer get swallowed by sidebar shortcuts
  on AZERTY and other international layouts, so characters such as `@`, `#`,
  `$`, `!`, and `%` can be entered normally (#2863, #2867). Thanks
  @ousamabenyounes for the fix and report.
- Sub-agent shell completions now refresh the workspace branch/status chip
  immediately, and `/subagents` plus the Agents sidebar show each sub-agent's
  current workspace branch when it is running in a child worktree.
- Authentication failures now include redacted request context such as provider,
  base URL authority, model, key source, key type, and key fingerprint, making
  stale provider, endpoint, or API-key state diagnosable without exposing the
  secret (#2665, #2792). Thanks @mvanhorn for the implementation.
- Browser-opening actions now compile on non-desktop targets by delegating the
  unsupported-platform error to the shared URL opener instead of hiding the TUI
  wrapper behind a narrower macOS/Linux/Windows cfg. Thanks @ci4ic4 for the
  NetBSD/pkgsrc packaging report and fix (#2789).
- MCP tool routing now preserves server names that contain underscores.
  `parse_prefixed_name` matches the qualified `mcp_<server>_<tool>` name against
  the set of registered server names and prefers the longest match, so tools on
  a server like `my_db` are reachable and an overlapping `my` / `my_db` pair
  routes correctly. Falls back to the legacy first-underscore split when no
  registered server matches (#2744).
- Schema-hydrated deferred tools no longer render as a completed run. The first
  use of a deferred tool returns a schema-hydration result instead of executing;
  the transcript and sidebar now show "tool loaded — retry required" via a
  dedicated hydrated status, so it is no longer indistinguishable from a real
  successful execution. A hydrated row also ranks with active work rather than
  completed successes (#2648).
- `codewhale sessions` now shows `codewhale resume <session-id>` in the footer
  instead of the invalid dispatcher command `codewhale --resume <session-id>`
  (#2758, #2760).
- TUI HTTP clients now install the Rustls ring crypto provider before building
  `reqwest` clients, covering engine, runtime API, tool, MCP, config, and skill
  download paths. This keeps the no-provider TLS build from panicking during
  tests or embedded startup paths that do not enter through the main binary.
- Prompt byte-stability tests now pin their temporary home and skills
  environment under the shared test-env lock so global skill directories cannot
  perturb deterministic prompt bytes during parallel test runs.

## [0.8.53] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Hugging Face Inference Providers.** Added `huggingface` as a native
  provider route (`/provider huggingface`). Supports `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`
  or `HF_TOKEN` for auth, `HUGGINGFACE_BASE_URL` and `HUGGINGFACE_MODEL`
  for overrides, and `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` / `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`
  as default models. Org-prefixed model IDs pass through.

### Fixed

- **Agent-mode shell error copy.** The missing-tool error for shell tools
  now directs users to `allow_shell = true` instead of nudging toward YOLO
  mode. `/config` surfaces `allow_shell` in the Permissions section.
- **Provider description.** `/provider` command description is now neutral
  instead of recommending specific providers.

### Community

Thanks to **@xyuai** for provider persistence, `/logout` scope clarification,
provider picker key replacement, and MiMo auth cleanup work (#2714, #2715,
#2717, #2718), and **@RefuseOdd** for configurable `path_suffix` support on
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (#2558).

## [0.8.52] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **SiliconFlow China region provider.** Added the `siliconflow-CN` provider
  variant for the China regional endpoint, sharing the existing
  `[providers.siliconflow]` credentials and `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` slot
  instead of creating a second credential namespace; the provider picker and
  registry docs now expose the regional route explicitly (#2588, #2615).
- **Multimodal `/attach` image forwarding.** Attached images are now sent as
  OpenAI-compatible `image_url` content blocks so multimodal providers can
  actually see image attachments (#2584, #2587, #2607).
- **Sub-agent lifecycle hooks and runtime metadata.** Sub-agent spawn/complete
  hook events, mode-change runtime messages, mode metadata on turns, localized
  context-inspector strings, and drag-to-resize sidebar width are included in
  this release slice.

### Fixed

- **Sub-agents now auto-cancel after stale heartbeats.** Running sub-agents
  track manager-visible progress and are auto-cancelled after the configurable
  `[subagents] heartbeat_timeout_secs` window (default 300s), releasing their
  concurrency slot and unblocking parent turns that would otherwise wait
  forever (#2603, #2614, #2620).
- **Work panel state survives transient lock misses.** The sidebar caches the
  last successful Work summary so checklist and strategy progress no longer
  disappear into "Work state updating..." while the engine briefly owns the
  shared todo/plan locks (#2606, #2616).
- **SiliconFlow-CN no longer breaks main.** Filled the missing CLI provider
  exhaustiveness arms and removed the duplicate/unreachable TUI config arms
  left by the #2615 landing; direct auth now stores the China-region variant in
  the shared SiliconFlow provider table (#2616, #2618, #2619).
- **v0.8.51 image-attach closure corrected.** The `/attach` multimodal fix
  landed after the v0.8.51 tag, so this release is the first version that
  actually contains it for users installing from the published release line
  (#2584, #2607).
- **Legacy SSE MCP reconnects are retryable again.** Closed or reset
  `POST /messages` requests on stale legacy SSE sessions now trigger the same
  reconnect-and-retry path as closed SSE streams, removing a release-gate flake
  and matching the intended recovery behavior (#2597).
- **Cache-hit cost accounting uses one telemetry source.** Mixed DeepSeek
  `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` and OpenAI-style `cached_tokens` usage payloads no
  longer infer cache misses from the wrong hit count, avoiding inflated TUI cost
  estimates on cached DeepSeek turns (#2567, #2609).
- **Cygwin/MSYS2 config paths honor exported `$HOME`.** CodeWhale and legacy
  DeepSeek config roots now prefer a non-empty `$HOME` before falling back to the
  platform home resolver, while `CODEWHALE_HOME` remains the strongest explicit
  override (#2369, #2610).

### Community

Thanks to **@xyuai** (#2587), **@IcedOranges** (#2584), **@BH8GCJ** (#2588),
**@shenjackyuanjie** (#2618, #2619), **@idling11** (#2606, #2616),
**@AresNing** (#2578), **@caiyilian** (#2567), **@buko** (#2369),
**@gordonlu**, **@encyc**, and **@simuusang** (#2603, #2620) for reports,
patches, retesting, and release-stabilization signals that shaped this pass.

## [0.8.51] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Arcee AI as a direct provider.** New `[providers.arcee]` config block and
  `ARCEE_API_KEY` / `ARCEE_BASE_URL` / `ARCEE_MODEL` environment variables,
  wired through CLI auth (`codewhale auth set --provider arcee`), the TUI
  provider picker, and the model registry. The default direct-API model is
  `trinity-large-thinking` (reasoning-capable, 262K context and 262K max
  output); `trinity-large-preview` (262K context, non-reasoning) and
  `trinity-mini` (128K context) are also selectable. OpenRouter's
  `arcee-ai/trinity-large-thinking` route remains separate.
- **Arcee Cloudflare-WAF compatibility.** The opening turn to the Arcee gateway
  uses a benign read-only tool surface (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `file_search`,
  `grep_files`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `checklist_write`, `update_plan`) and
  splits example payloads such as `python -c …` out of the system prompt, so the
  WAF does not reject the first request; the full tool catalog stays reachable
  through tool-search. `trinity-large-thinking`'s `reasoning_content` is
  recognized and replayed on tool-call turns.
- **Expanded model catalog.** Added context-window, max-output, and
  reasoning-capability metadata for additional model IDs, including
  `qwen/qwen3.6-flash`, `qwen/qwen3.6-plus`, `qwen/qwen3.6-max-preview`, and
  Xiaomi MiMo v2.5 chat/ASR/TTS variants; `trinity-large-preview`'s context
  window was corrected to 262K.
- **Provider-aware model picker.** The picker groups models by provider, shows
  per-model hints, and remembers a saved model per provider.

### Changed

- **Auto-compaction is now percentage- and model-aware.** The per-model
  threshold helper is `compaction_threshold_for_model_at_percent(model,
  percent)` (replacing the effort-based variant), and the default
  `auto_compact_threshold_percent` is 80%. Auto-compaction defaults on for
  models with a context window of 256K or smaller and stays opt-in for 1M-token
  models (e.g. DeepSeek V4) to protect prefix-cache economics, unless the user
  has explicitly set `auto_compact`.
- **Clearer provider/gateway errors.** HTTP error bodies are sanitized before
  display — HTML interstitials and Cloudflare "Access Denied" pages collapse to
  a one-line reason (with the ray/error ID) instead of dumping raw markup into
  the transcript — and 403s are split into authentication vs. authorization
  (gateway/WAF block) categories.
- The invalid-model error now names the active provider and lists Arcee among
  the options.

### Removed

- **The session "cycle" / checkpoint-restart system.** Removed the `/cycles`,
  `/cycle <n>`, and `/recall` commands, the `recall_archive` tool, the
  cycle-handoff briefing prompt, the sidebar "cycles" lines, and the
  `cycle_manager` engine plumbing (`EngineConfig.cycle`, `Event::CycleAdvanced`,
  seam-manager cycle thresholds and flash briefings). Long sessions no longer
  auto-reset their context at a fixed token boundary — reclaim budget with
  `/compact` or model-aware auto-compaction instead. Existing on-disk cycle
  archives are left untouched but are no longer read or written.

### Fixed

- Assistant turns no longer leave an orphaned role glyph (the stray "blue dot")
  when a turn streams only whitespace between reasoning and a tool call.
- Scrolling the mouse wheel over the right-hand sidebar no longer leaks into the
  transcript scroll.
- The sidebar hover tooltip now appears only for truncated lines, sits below the
  cursor, and uses a neutral surface color instead of the warning-orange
  highlight that overlapped neighbouring rows.
- Corrected the README's description of the Constitution (Article VII is the
  hierarchy itself; Article II's truth duty overrides even a user request) to
  match `prompts/base.md`.
- Repaired release-blocking unit and integration tests left failing by the
  cycle-removal and compaction-threshold refactors (relay instruction,
  model-reject message, compaction budget, mock-LLM threshold helper).
- Fixed DEC private-mode CSI fragment leakage into composer text after
  terminal resets, restoring clean prompt editing (#2592).
- The engine now recovers from turn-level panics instead of killing the
  main event loop, keeping the session alive through transient failures
  (#2583, #1269).
- Deeply nested files are now discoverable via @-mention and Ctrl+P file
  picker; the default walk depth was relaxed to handle monorepo layouts (#2488).
- Command-palette selection stays visible when scrolling through long lists
  instead of scrolling off-screen (#2590).
- exec_shell child processes now inherit .NET/NuGet and Windows app-data
  environment variables, fixing toolchain resolution on Windows (#1857).
- A warning is emitted when shell/sandbox config keys are nested under
  unknown top-level sections instead of being silently ignored (#2589).
- Diff-render now preserves leading whitespace in patch content lines,
  fixing an extra-space regression in PR previews (#2591). Thanks @zlh124.
- Model selection from the /model command now persists per-provider across
  restarts, with a warning when persistence fails.

### Community

Thanks to **@zlh124** (#2591) and **@reidliu41** (#2601) for the fixes
harvested into this release. Thanks also to **@idling11** (#2602),
**@gordonlu** (#2585), **@cyq1017** (#2593), **@xyuai** (#2587, #2584),
and **@IcedOranges** (#2584) for reports, drafts, and investigations
that shaped this release cycle.

## [0.8.50] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added a Windows NSIS installer release artifact and classroom/lab deployment
  checklist, harvested from #2045 for #1987. The release workflow now builds
  `CodeWhaleSetup.exe` from the canonical Windows binaries, and the installer
  adds/removes only the exact current-user PATH entry.
- Added deterministic session timestamps in session listings, receipt-export
  boundary docs, and current-model turn metadata for routed/auto sessions.
- Added exact AtlasCloud provider-hinted model ID pass-through for explicit
  `vendor/model-id` selections, harvested from #2569 without freezing a
  brittle provider catalog.
- Added Xiaomi MiMo speech/TTS support with a `codewhale speech` CLI command,
  `tts` tool alias, and config wiring for voice-design and voice-clone models,
  harvested from #2560.
- Added a three-zone immutable prefix diagnostic layer (FrozenPrefix Phase 2)
  that logs cache-prefix drift at debug level without blocking requests,
  harvested from #2514.
- Added a Cache Guard CI integration test suite simulating prefix-cache
  behaviour across nine scenarios, gated behind `CODEWHALE_CACHE_GUARD=1`,
  harvested from #2503.
- Added a plan-mode byte-stability invariant test verifying that the tool
  catalog head remains byte-identical across mode toggles, harvested from
  #2519.
- Localized all 15 `/queue` command messages across 7 shipped locales,
  harvested from #2568.
- Added localized `FanoutCounts` MessageId for i18n of the aggregate worker
  stats line in fanout cards, harvested from #2566.
- Added contribution gate CI workflows (PR gate, issue gate, contributor
  approval) with a dry-run mode, harvested from #2565.

### Changed

- Hardened theme repainting and sidebar color use so theme switches do not
  leave stale Whale-dark panel colors behind.
- Made legacy config migration visible when CodeWhale copies old DeepSeek-era
  config into the CodeWhale config path.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/context` to use the effective routed model for context-window
  budgeting, so DeepSeek V4 routes report the 1M-token window and legacy
  DeepSeek routes keep the 128K fallback.
- Fixed npm wrapper version output so `--version` prefers the installed binary
  version instead of stale package metadata when both are available.
- Fixed multiline composer arrow navigation so holding Up/Down at the first or
  last line no longer replaces the current draft with prompt history.
- Fixed foreground `exec_shell` output collection so timeout and inherited-pipe
  cleanup cannot wedge later tool calls behind the global tool lock.
- Clarified the English DeepSeek account-balance footer chip from `bal` to
  `balance` so it is less likely to be mistaken for session spend.
- Fixed truncated subagent tool calls and repeated truncated subagent responses
  so they return model-visible errors instead of silently failing.
- Moved Paste to the first position in the right-click context menu so users
  copying text from the output area can paste with a single left-click instead
  of navigating past cell-specific actions.

## [0.8.49] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added the missing `[providers.moonshot]` example block for Moonshot/Kimi,
  documented `completion_sound`, and refreshed the tool-surface docs for the
  current registry, including `finance`, `web.run`, git history tools, memory,
  OCR, and other registered tools.

### Changed

- Hardened prefix-cache fingerprints to hash API-visible tool schema details,
  not just tool names, so schema and description drift invalidates cached
  prefixes before it can confuse model calls (#2264).
- Kept `finance` registered independently from web-search tools and prevented
  duplicate web/patch tool registration in agent and YOLO modes.

### Fixed

- Fixed the DeepSeek V4-Pro cost estimate after the 2026-05-31 pricing cutoff:
  the post-promotion official rate remains one quarter of the original price,
  so CodeWhale no longer shows roughly 4x too much after June 1 (#2489).
- Fixed Kimi/Moonshot tool schema normalization by moving parent `type` fields
  into `anyOf`/`oneOf` items, with regression coverage for nested schema shapes
  that could otherwise still fail Kimi validation (#2438).
- Fixed raw ANSI/SGR fragments leaking into footer, shell-label, and sidebar
  activity text during active tool execution (#2481).
- Fixed `[tui]` config parsing when `status_items` is omitted, restoring the
  documented default footer order for older and hand-written configs (#2483).
- Fixed a shell env-scrubbing test so it does not depend on the user's default
  shell understanding POSIX parameter expansion.
- Removed stale `qwen/qwen3.7-max` references left in `config.example.toml`
  after the v0.8.48 preset removal.

### Community

Thanks to **@idling11** (#2480, #2485), **@reidliu41** (#2493),
**@hongqitai** (#2495), and **@encyc** (#2477) for the fixes and reliability
work harvested into this release.

Thanks also to reporters and verification helpers whose issues shaped the
release: **@A-Corner** (#2438), **@taiwan988** (#2483), **@AiurArtanis**
(#2489), and **@Hmbown** (#2481).

## [0.8.48] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Recent large OpenRouter model presets.** Added completions, aliases,
  routing metadata, and docs for Arcee Trinity Large Thinking,
  MiniMax M3, Xiaomi MiMo v2.5, Qwen 3.6 open-weight models, Kimi K2.6,
  GLM 5.1, Tencent Hy3, Gemma 4, and Nemotron (#2461).
- **Provider and web-search expansion.** Added Xiaomi MiMo provider support,
  SiliconFlow, AtlasCloud static models, Volcengine Ark search, Baidu AI
  Search, provider-picker coverage, and richer custom-provider docs
  (#2246, #1868, #2421, #2429, #2371, #2394, #2287).
- **Workflow and tool ergonomics.** Added the external-tool abstraction,
  pluggable TUI tool registry, custom slash-command allowed-tools enforcement,
  opt-in Unix socket hook sink, message-submit transform hooks, tool-cache
  introspection, and cache warmup-key tracking (#2294, #2420, #2326, #2430,
  #2434, #2423, #2424).
- **TUI workflow features.** Added `/purge`, `/hunt`, thinking fold/unfold,
  terminal-transparent/Solarized Light/Claude themes, footer branch display,
  macOS notifications, intent summaries before approval prompts, and the
  mobile runtime smoke/QR workflow (#2387, #2306, #2385, #2276, #2270, #2267,
  #2347, #2260, #2389, #2403).
- **Platform and localization coverage.** Added RISC-V prebuilt-binary
  support, Vietnamese localization, Java/Vue language-server defaults, runtime
  event envelopes, task migration/env isolation fixes, and state-message
  parent IDs for future forks (#2383, #2358, #2367, #2252, #2272, #2308).

### Removed

- **Qwen 3.7 Max OpenRouter preset.** Removed from the model registry, docs,
  and examples. Qwen 3.7 Max is a hosted model, not open-source; the preset
  will return when an open-weight Qwen 3.7 release ships.

### Changed

- **Release hardening.** CI now runs clippy/docs checks, web frontend lint and
  type checks, provider-registry drift checks, broader crate docs, and a large
  unit-test pass across core, MCP, TUI core, app-server, and web helpers
  (#2443, #2444, #2274, #2446-#2460, #2440, #2441, #2450, #2448, #2454).
- **Prompt, context, and model routing behavior.** Stabilized project-context
  pack ordering, exposed the auto route in turn metadata, allowed embedders to
  override or inline constitutional instructions, moved volatile environment
  context below the prompt boundary, and used the effective model for
  compaction budgeting (#2418, #2410, #2356, #2311, #2314, #2437).
- **Execution policy foundation.** Added typed ask-rule groundwork and kept
  `task_shell_start` gated behind `allow_shell`, preparing the permission UI
  path without broadening default shell access (#2404, #2384).

### Fixed

- **Windows and shell reliability.** Suppressed alt-screen logging on Windows,
  added the Windows batch launcher path, kept task shell tools eagerly loaded,
  loaded exec-shell companion tools consistently, covered controlling-terminal
  behavior, and improved shell tool availability errors (#2259, #2295, #1861,
  #2271, #2331, #2414, #2412).
- **Session and transcript durability.** Fixed hidden-worktree discovery
  saturation, stalled in-progress turn recovery, session persistence
  truncation, cached-transcript user-message highlighting, large tool-output
  receipting, session-detail block serialization, and deterministic composer
  history flushing (#2273, #2329, #2283, #2395, #2386, #2297, #2265, #2375).
- **Provider and UI polish.** Accepted custom model IDs in `/model` for
  non-DeepSeek providers, fixed Feishu per-chat model switching, localized
  context-menu labels, updated terminal tab naming, kept picker selections
  visible, allowed slash-space composer messages, and improved PDF text
  cleanup (#2280, #2149, #2320, #2319, #2324, #2316, #2266).
- **Security and dependency hygiene.** Bumped `tar` and `qs`, trusted fake-IP
  placeholder ranges only when explicitly configured, decoded Bing result URL
  entities, fixed legacy MCP SSE connections, and replaced manual tool error
  display code with `thiserror` derives (#2364, #2425, #2355, #2245, #2301,
  #2442).

## [0.8.47] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Closed-loop verification gate, runtime goal tools, DuckDuckGo default
  web search, Xiaomi MiMo, global AGENTS.md fallback, `/new`, composer
  selection, transcript copy cleanup, CNB mirror support, and Docker toolbox
  docs** shipped in the published v0.8.47 release.

### Changed

- **DeepSeek-first release framing, project-context logging, state-root
  migration, CodeWhale README paths, and reasoning-locale behavior** were
  finalized for the v0.8.47 release.

### Fixed

- **Provider picker scrolling, auto model restore, cache-inspect hashing,
  insecure LAN provider guard, large tool-output compaction, queued-message
  ordering, shell/Yolo startup handling, Windows alt-screen logging, and
  tooltip contrast** were fixed in the v0.8.47 release.

### Community

Thanks to contributors credited in the v0.8.47 GitHub Release, including
**@Fire-dtx**, **@imkingjh999**, **@harvey2011888**, **@victorcheng2333**,

## [0.8.46] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`CODEWHALE_*` env aliases.** `CODEWHALE_PROVIDER`, `CODEWHALE_MODEL`,
  and `CODEWHALE_BASE_URL` are public product-scoped aliases that take
  precedence over the legacy `DEEPSEEK_*` forms. The `DEEPSEEK_*` names
  remain accepted for back-compat.
- **Platform archive bundles.** Release artifacts now ship as per-platform
  archives (`tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `.zip` for Windows) containing both
  `codewhale` and `codewhale-tui` binaries plus an install script. No more
  downloading two loose files and guessing which ones to pick (#2193).
- **Windows portable archive.** `codewhale-windows-x64-portable.zip` ships
  the two binaries without an install script for USB-stick distribution
  (#2193).
- **Web install download tile.** The website install page now shows a
  platform-aware download tile with arch detection, SHA256 checksum
  display, and China mirror links, instead of burying the download behind
  the Cargo instructions (#2192).
- **Whale dark palette refresh.** Better contrast and layer separation
  across the TUI color scheme (#2197).
- **Auto-collapse finished sub-agents.** Completed sub-agent sessions now
  collapse automatically in the sidebar, reducing noise during long
  sessions (#2195).
- **Shell-running status chip.** A `⏳ shell running` chip appears in the
  TUI footer while background shell tasks are active (#2194).
- **Sandbox process hardening (Linux).** `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0`,
  `NO_NEW_PRIVS`, and `RLIMIT_CORE=0` are applied at shell startup to
  harden child processes against inspection and privilege escalation
  (#2183).
- **CONTRIBUTING.md cross-links.** Issue and PR templates are now
  cross-linked from CONTRIBUTING.md to improve contributor onboarding
  (#2203).

### Changed

- **DeepSeek-first focus.** v0.8.46 refocuses on delivering the
  highest-quality experience on DeepSeek first. Additional first-class
  provider paths are planned for v0.9.0 after the core DeepSeek workflow
  is solid.

### Fixed

- **Model name casing preserved.** `normalize_model_name_for_provider` no
  longer lowercases user-set model names such as `DeepSeek-V4-Flash`,
  preventing API lookup failures on case-sensitive backends (#2109).
- **Esc in model picker applies selection.** Dismissing the model picker
  with Esc now applies the last-highlighted choice instead of reverting
  (#2196).
- **Web install downloads both binaries.** The `install-binary.tsx`
  snippet now fetches both `codewhale` and `codewhale-tui`, fixing the
  `MISSING_COMPANION_BINARY` trap on fresh npm installs (#2191).
- **`grep_files` skips large directories.** The pure-Rust search tool
  now skips known-large directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`)
  before walking, preventing hangs on deep or slow filesystems.
- **Version-update hint uses semver.** The update notification in the
  footer now compares versions semantically instead of lexicographically,
  so `0.8.10 > 0.8.9` is recognized correctly.
- **CVE-2026-8723 in feishu-bridge.** Bumped `qs` to `>=6.15.2` in the
  Feishu bridge integration (#2198).

## [0.8.45] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **RLM session objects.** `rlm_open` can now load `session://` refs,
  exposing the active prompt, history, and session data as symbolic objects
  inside RLM REPLs (#2047).
- **Command palette voice input.** The command palette can launch a configured
  speech-to-text helper and show footer status while transcription runs
  (#2047).
- **Moonshot/Kimi provider.** Moonshot/Kimi is now a first-class provider,
  including API-key auth, model completion, CLI auth, secret-store
  integration, and optional Kimi CLI credential reuse.
- **Deterministic whale-species sub-agent names.** Sub-agents now get stable,
  human-readable whale-species nicknames (e.g. "Beluga", "Orca") while
  preserving the raw agent ID in the popup (#2035, #2016).
- **`/balance` command scaffold.** Registered the `/balance` slash command
  as a placeholder for future provider billing queries (#2035, #2019).
- **Readable `/restore` snapshot labels.** Snapshot labels now include the
  originating user prompt so restore listings are easier to identify. Thanks
  @idling11 (#2111).
- **Sidebar hover tooltips.** Truncated Work and Tasks sidebar lines now expose
  their full text on hover. Thanks @idling11 (#2110).

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md is now maintainer-local.** The project instructions file no
  longer ships as a tracked repo file; it lives in maintainer-local ignored
  state (#2047).

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent completion handoff compatibility.** Completion handoffs now use a
  chat-template-safe role and emit before terminal updates, fixing strict
  OpenAI-compatible/self-hosted backends and preserving transcript ordering.
  Thanks @h3c-hexin and @cyq1017 (#2057, #2120).
- **Self-hosted context budgeting.** Sub-500K self-hosted model windows now keep
  a usable input budget instead of disabling preflight compaction after output
  reservation underflow. Thanks @h3c-hexin (#2060).
- **Goal prompts start actionable.** Goal-start prompts now open in an
  actionable state instead of requiring an extra nudge. Thanks @cyq1017
  (#2097).
- **Composer session title display.** The composer chrome shows the current
  session title again and avoids grayscale luma overflow in debug builds.
  Thanks @wdw8276 (#2108).
- **Approval prompts use a one-step confirmation flow.** Enter now commits the
  selected approval option directly, destructive warnings remain visible, and
  abort cancels the active turn instead of only denying the current tool call.
  Thanks @reidliu41 (#2143).
- **Model picker selection survives Esc.** Dismissing the model picker with Esc
  no longer loses the highlighted selection. Thanks @reidliu41 (#2056).
- **Moonshot/Kimi sessions launch from the dispatcher.** The `codewhale`
  wrapper now includes Moonshot/Kimi in the TUI provider allowlist, so
  `codewhale --provider moonshot --model kimi-k2.6` reaches the TUI instead of
  stopping after config resolution.
- **Slash recovery no longer restores command tails in the composer.**
  Resuming a session or recovering from a crash no longer leaves stale
  slash-command text (e.g. `/sessions`) in the composer input (#2047, #2032).
- **Remembered tool approvals now update the live active turn.**
  When the "remember" checkbox is set on an approval dialog, the active
  turn's auto-approve flag flips immediately instead of waiting for the
  next turn. Thanks @gaord (#2047, #2041).
- **YAML block scalars in SKILL.md frontmatter.** Multi-line descriptions
  using `>` or `|` indicators are now parsed correctly — folded block
  scalars join non-empty lines with spaces, literal scalars preserve
  newlines, and all three chomping modes (strip/clip/keep) are supported.
  Thanks @zlh124 (#1908, #1907).
- **User messages highlighted in the transcript.** User-authored messages
  now render with a full-row background in the live TUI transcript, making
  it easier to scan prior turns. Assistant and system messages are
  unaffected. Thanks @reidliu41 (#1995, #1672).
- **Cancellable `list_dir` and `file_search`.** Long directory walks and
  file searches now respond to user cancel/stop requests with a 30-second
  fallback timeout, preventing the TUI from hanging on deep or slow
  filesystems (#2035).

### Community

- **README contributor acknowledgements resynced.** The Thanks list now
  includes the latest contributor rows for @donglovejava, @encyc,
  @saieswar237, @sximelon, @nanookclaw, @Sskift, @xin1104, @mrluanma,
  @Lellansin, and @zhuangbiaowei, while preserving the existing @jeoor
  acknowledgement in the consolidated list.

## [0.8.44] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`codew` convenience alias.** `codew` is a short-form command that silently
  forwards to `codewhale`. Six fewer keystrokes, same binary. Ships with the
  Rust `codewhale-cli` crate and the npm `codewhale` package (#2013).
- **Session picker inline rename.** Press `r` in the session picker (Ctrl+R)
  to rename the selected session inline. Type the new title, Enter to confirm,
  Esc to cancel (#1600).
- **Plan detail display.** The \"Plan Confirmation\" modal now shows the plan
  explanation and step list from `update_plan` so you can review what was
  proposed before accepting (#834).
- **Agent team UX.** Delegate cards in the transcript now show human-readable
  roles (scout, builder, reviewer, verifier, executor) and the completion
  summary instead of raw `agent_xxx` IDs (#1981).
- **`--continue` / `-c` CLI flag.** `codewhale --continue` resumes your most
  recent interactive session for the current workspace.

### Changed

- **App state migrates to `~/.codewhale/`.** New installs write product-owned
  state (config, sessions, tasks, skills, logs, etc.) under `~/.codewhale/`.
  `~/.deepseek/` continues to work as a compatibility fallback — no data loss,
  no forced migration. `CODEWHALE_HOME` and `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH` env vars
  are now supported alongside existing `DEEPSEEK_*` vars (#2011).
- **Project config overlay prefers `.codewhale/config.toml`** before
  `.deepseek/config.toml`. Both are read; the CodeWhale root takes precedence.
- **Doctor reports active state root** and whether legacy `~/.deepseek/`
  state is also present.
- **README contributor acknowledgements are current for this release.**
  Thanks @jeoor, @LING71671, and @ousamabenyounes for the fixes and reports
  now reflected in the public credits.
- **Harvested-contribution credit audit completed.** The README Thanks list now
  includes previously missed community helpers whose code, reports, or review
  notes were already credited in older changelog entries but not in the public
  contributor surface: @mvanhorn, @krisclarkdev, @tdccccc, @LittleBlacky,
  @AnaheimEX, @THatch26, @alvin1, @knqiufan, @IIzzaya, @duanchao-lab,
  @imkingjh999, @eng2007, @chennest, @kunpeng-ai-lab, @asdfg314284230,
  @maker316, @lalala-233, @muyuliyan, @czf0718, @MeAiRobot, @tiger-dog,
  @MMMarcinho, @lucaszhu-hue, @sandofree, @zhuangbiaowei, @NorethSea,
  @Jianfengwu2024, @Fire-dtx, @oooyuy92, @qinxianyuzou, @tyouter,
  @xulongzhe, @YaYII, @47Cid, and @JafarAkhondali.
- **Harvest guidance now requires GitHub-visible attribution.** Maintainer
  harvests should preserve the original commit author where possible or add
  `Co-authored-by` trailers from the original PR commits, in addition to the
  existing `Harvested from PR #N by @handle` trailer and changelog credit.
- **Enter now steers when busy-waiting.** When the model is busy but not
  actively streaming (waiting on tool results, sub-agents, or shell
  commands), pressing Enter tries to steer your message into the current
  turn instead of silently queueing it. During active streaming, Enter
  still queues to avoid interrupting in-flight reasoning (#2009).

### Fixed

- **`/save` no longer creates repo-local `session_*.json`.** Default saves
  now go to the managed sessions directory instead of the current workspace.
  Explicit `/save path/to/file.json` exports still work as before (#2010).
- **Boot-time session prune** caps managed sessions at 50 on every startup,
  preventing unbounded growth of `~/.codewhale/sessions/`.
- **Checkpoint path resolution** no longer hardcodes `~/.deepseek/` — uses
  the resolved session directory instead.
- **Plain startup no longer auto-opens the session picker.** `codewhale` and
  `codew` start in a fresh composer again even when saved sessions exist.
  Use `/sessions`, Ctrl+R, `--resume`, or `--continue` when you want to resume.
- **Work sidebar now refreshes immediately** after `checklist_write`,
  `checklist_update`, and `update_plan` tool calls, matching the existing
  `todo_write` behavior instead of relying on the 2.5s periodic poll (#1787).

## [0.8.43] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **`grep_files` now respects the cancellation token.** Long-running file
  searches cancel promptly instead of running to completion after the user
  aborts (#1839). Thanks @LING71671.
- **npm installer stream-pause race condition fixed.** The install script now
  pauses HTTP response streams immediately, preventing early data loss that
  caused "Invalid checksum manifest line" errors (#1860). Thanks @jeoor.
- **Ctrl+Z restores the last cleared composer draft.** Pressing Ctrl+Z in an
  empty composer recovers the text that was last cleared with Ctrl+U or
  Ctrl+S, matching the muscle memory users expect from other editors (#1911).
  Thanks @LING71671.
- **Clipboard works on non-wlroots Wayland compositors.** The Linux clipboard
  path now tries `wl-copy` before `arboard`, fixing silent copy failures on
  niri, River, cosmic-comp, and GNOME mutter (#1938). Thanks @ousamabenyounes.

### Added

- **`/goal` remains the persistent objective surface.** Use `/goal <objective>`
  to set a goal and `/goal done` to mark it complete. Goal status appears in
  the Work sidebar with elapsed time, but it does not change Plan / Agent /
  YOLO mode or approval behavior. A tabbed Ralph-style Goal loop is deferred to
  v0.8.44 (#2007).
- **Post-turn receipts cite evidence for every completed turn.** When a turn
  finishes, a receipt line shows in the transcript tail with a summary of
  tool calls, file changes, and evidence that supports the agent's claims.
  Tool evidence is collected per-turn and flushed on new dispatch.
- **Stall reason classification.** When a turn has been running for more than
  30 seconds, the footer now appends a classified reason: "waiting for model",
  "tools executing", "sub-agents working", "compacting context", or "waiting —
  no recent activity".
- **Decision card widget for structured user input.** When Brother Whale needs
  a choice, it surfaces a bordered card with numbered options, keyboard
  navigation (1-9 / j/k / arrows), and Enter/Esc to confirm or cancel.
- **Tasks sidebar now shows fuller turn IDs and supports copy-to-clipboard.**
  Turn ID prefixes are widened from 12 to 16 characters for disambiguation,
  background job status is presented as "X running, Y completed" instead of
  ambiguous "X active (Y running)", and `y` / `Y` yank affordances copy the
  current turn ID or full status line to the system clipboard (#1975).

### Changed

- **Contributor count and acknowledgement surfaces refreshed.** The website
  fallback contributor count now reflects 98 live GitHub contributors (up from
  the stale 91). All three README translations (English, 中文, 日本語) now
  include 30+ previously unlisted contributors whose PRs were merged since
  April 2026.
- **README and web surface rebrand refinements.** Crate descriptions, npm
  package text, and website copy now consistently position CodeWhale as
  open-model-first and provider-spanning, with DeepSeek V4 as the first-class
  path.
- **New contributor names added to README acknowledgements.** Thanks to
  @Apeiron0w0, @aqilaziz, @ChaceLyee2101, @ComeFromTheMars, @CrepuscularIRIS,
  @dst1213, @eltociear, @fuleinist, @greyfreedom, @h3c-hexin, @heloanc,
  @hxy91819, @J3y0r, @JiarenWang, @jinpengxuan, @KhalidAlnujaidi, @laoye2020,
  @lbcheng888, @linzhiqin2003, @Liu-Vince, @lixiasky-back, @pengyou200902,
  @punkcanyang, @Rene-Kuhm, @SamhandsomeLee, @sockerch, @sternelee,
  @Wenjunyun123, @whtis, and @wuwuzhijing for the translations, typo fixes,
  docs polish, and small UX improvements that landed across the 0.8.42 →
  0.8.43 cycle.

### Security

- **Thinking blocks can be collapsed/expanded via keyboard.** Space on an
  empty composer toggles the focused thinking cell between collapsed and
  expanded, complementing the existing mouse right-click context menu (#1972).
- **Sub-agent completion events no longer delayed to the next turn.** The turn
  loop now drains late-arriving sub-agent completions at the final checkpoint
  before breaking, so child-agent sentinels surface immediately instead of
  appearing in the following turn (#1961).
- **`codewhale doctor` now referenced correctly in SSE timeout errors.**
  The error message shown when SSE streams fail to connect now points users to
  `codewhale doctor` (not the legacy `deepseek doctor`).

## [0.8.42] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **CodeWhale now ships with the Brother Whale agent identity prompt.** The
  built-in system prompt frames the agent as trusted, calm, careful, and
  responsible, and adds the coordination principle that great intelligence
  creates spaces where future intelligences can work together.
- **CodeWhale positioning is clarified as DeepSeek-first and open-model
  oriented.** README, rebrand notes, crate metadata, and npm package text now
  describe CodeWhale as an agentic terminal for open source and open-weight
  coding models while preserving the official DeepSeek provider as first-class.
- **Model auto-routing is documented separately from TUI modes.** README and
  modes docs now reserve "mode" for Plan / Agent / YOLO, describe
  `--model auto` as model/thinking routing, and name the fast
  `deepseek-v4-flash` thinking-off seam as Fin.
- **Rebrand shim docs now match the v0.8.x transition window.** The npm and
  migration notes no longer imply the legacy `deepseek-tui` package/shims
  expired immediately after v0.8.41.

### Fixed

- **User-authored messages render as literal plain text.** Leading whitespace,
  whitespace-only lines, repeated spaces, and Markdown-looking `#` / `-` text
  now survive in transcript history, while assistant messages still render
  Markdown normally.
- **English turns stay English after localized context.** The Brother Whale
  identity and base language rules no longer inject native-script examples into
  the English prompt path, and the prompt now calls out localized READMEs, issue
  text, file contents, and tool results as data rather than language signals.
- **Stream decode failures no longer leave the turn visually stuck.** The UI
  now marks an active turn failed and flushes live cells as soon as the engine
  emits a stream error, so the sidebar/footer recover without requiring
  Ctrl+C (#1960).
- **RLM contexts now expose `_ctx`.** Persistent RLM REPLs bind `_ctx` as a
  compatibility alias for the loaded source alongside `_context` and
  `content`, and the prompt/docs call out the exact names (#1962).
- **`handle_read` is easier to recover from.** The tool keeps accepting full
  `var_handle` objects directly, adds `introspect: true` for size/projection
  hints, and validation failures now include copy-pasteable examples (#1963).
- **The help picker keeps the selected row visible while scrolling.** `/help`
  now budgets against the real modal body height, wraps Up/Down navigation,
  and uses a stronger selected-row highlight (#1964).
- **Unicode `git_status` paths stay readable.** Chinese and other non-ASCII
  repository paths now survive status parsing and display cleanly (#1936,
  #1953).
- **Project-local and configured skills appear in the slash menu.** Workspace
  skills and configured skill directories now feed the command picker instead
  of only the bundled set (#1955, #1956).
- **Repeated Tab mode switching no longer stacks composer-obscuring toasts.**
  The mode-switch notification now deduplicates instead of accumulating rows
  over the composer (#1926, #1957).
- **Local tool UX surfaces are clearer.** `github_close_pr` now has the same
  guarded closure workflow as issue close, `handle_read` redirects artifact
  refs to `retrieve_tool_result`, Plan handoffs use plainer wording, and shell
  rows/sidebar tasks show the actual running command instead of placeholder
  labels.

### Thanks

Thanks to **cyq ([@cyq1017](https://github.com/cyq1017))** for the Unicode
`git_status`, local/configured skill discovery, and mode-switch toast fixes in
#1953, #1956, and #1957. Thanks to **Reid
([@reidliu41](https://github.com/reidliu41))** for the help picker scrolling
and selection fix in #1964.

## [0.8.41] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **Project renamed to codewhale.** The canonical CLI dispatcher is now
  `codewhale` (was `deepseek`) and the TUI runtime is `codewhale-tui`
  (was `deepseek-tui`). The 14 workspace crates are renamed from
  `deepseek-*` / `deepseek-tui-*` to `codewhale-*` / `codewhale-tui-*`.
  The npm wrapper package is now `codewhale` (was `deepseek-tui`). See
  [docs/REBRAND.md](docs/REBRAND.md) for migration notes.
- **DeepSeek provider integration is unchanged.** `DEEPSEEK_*` env vars,
  model IDs (`deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, the legacy
  `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` aliases), the
  `https://api.deepseek.com` host, and the `~/.deepseek/` config
  directory are all preserved.

### Deprecated

- The `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary names continue to ship as
  tiny shims that print a one-line warning and forward argv to the
  renamed binaries. They will be removed in v0.9.0.
- The `deepseek-tui` npm package continues to publish for one release
  cycle as a no-`bin` deprecation shim whose postinstall directs users
  to `npm install -g codewhale`. It will be removed in v0.9.0.

### Fixed

- **Windows CI spillover tests are isolated.** Tool-result deduplication
  tests now use a temporary spillover root guarded by the existing global
  spillover mutex, removing the shared-state race that made Windows CI fail
  unrelated PRs (#1943).
- **Terminated sub-agents keep `agent_eval` recoverable.** Evaluating a
  completed child session now returns the available transcript result instead
  of losing the final output (#1738, #1928).
- **Bare `@/` completions no longer freeze the TUI.** File-mention
  completion skips bare separator and dot tokens so Windows/WSL2 workspaces
  do not trigger an eager 4096-entry filesystem walk on the UI thread
  (#1921, #1929).
- **Enter paths avoid synchronous UI-thread waits.** Composer history writes,
  offline queue persistence, feedback URL launching, and clipboard fallback
  helpers now run off the hot Enter path where appropriate (#1927, #1931,
  #1940, #1941, #1944).
- **tmux and screen sessions stop idling as terminal activity.** Terminal
  multiplexers now force low-motion behavior and pin the fallback footer label
  so passive animations do not trip activity monitors (#1925, #1942).
- **Composer sanitization catches OSC 8 and Kitty fragments.** The input
  sanitizer now strips common hyperlink and keyboard-protocol fragments that
  leaked into drafts while preserving ordinary prose (#1915, #1933).
- **The Work sidebar hides stale completed tasks.** Terminal task records older
  than the current session and outside the recent-completion window no longer
  crowd active Work sidebar rows (#1913, #1930).
- **V4 Pro pricing docs reflect permanent rates.** The English, Simplified
  Chinese, and Japanese READMEs now describe the V4 Pro pricing change as
  permanent instead of temporary (#1923, #1932).

### Thanks

Thanks to **OpenWarp ([@zerx-lab](https://github.com/zerx-lab))** for
prioritizing codewhale support and collaborating on terminal-agent UX.
Thanks to **[@leo119](https://github.com/leo119)** for the update-command
documentation lineage now preserved through the rename.

## [0.8.40] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Configurable sub-agent per-step API timeout.** A new
  `[subagents] api_timeout_secs` setting in `~/.deepseek/config.toml`
  controls how long each sub-agent step will wait on a DeepSeek
  `create_message` response before falling back. The value is clamped to
  `1..=1800`; `0` or unset preserves the legacy 120-second default, so
  existing installs see no behavior change. Long-thinking children (e.g.
  heavy plan or review work behind `agent_open`) can extend the timeout
  without recompiling (#1806, #1808).
- **Delegated file-write permissions for write-capable sub-agent roles.**
  `implementer` and `custom` sub-agents may now run `Suggest`-level write
  tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`) without the parent
  runtime being auto-approved. Read-only stances (`explore`, `plan`,
  `review`, `verifier`) and the default `general` role still bounce
  approval-gated tools so they can't quietly mutate the workspace, and
  `Required`-level tools (shell, etc.) still need parent auto-approve
  regardless of role. Pick `implementer` (or pass an explicit `custom`
  allowlist) when the delegated task needs to land file changes
  (#1828, #1833).
- **Experimental Fin fast-lane tool agents.** `tool_agent` opens a durable
  child session on DeepSeek V4 Flash with thinking forced off for simple
  tool-bound work such as OCR, file/search lookups, fetches, and command
  probes. It uses the existing `agent_eval` / `agent_close` lifecycle and
  mailbox token-usage stream, so sub-agent cost accounting stays on the same
  path as normal `agent_open` sessions.

### Fixed

- **WSL2 and headless Linux startup no longer blocks on clipboard init.** The
  TUI now defers clipboard initialization so machines without an X server can
  reach the first frame instead of hanging on a blank screen (#1773, #1772).
- **Windows alt-screen output stays clean when `RUST_LOG` is set.** Runtime
  tracing is routed away from the interactive buffer so logs no longer leak
  into the TUI display (#1774, #1776).
- **OpenAI-compatible custom model names are preserved.** Non-DeepSeek
  providers now pass explicit model names through instead of rewriting them to
  a DeepSeek default (#1714, #1740).
- **Wanjie Ark is a first-class provider.** `--provider wanjie-ark`, the TUI
  provider picker, `deepseek auth`, doctor, and config files now target
  Wanjie's OpenAI-compatible MaaS endpoint with pass-through model IDs and
  Wanjie-specific env vars.
- **DeepSeek reasoning replay works through OpenAI-compatible endpoints.**
  DeepSeek models selected under the generic `openai` provider now replay
  prior `reasoning_content` consistently and classify streamed reasoning the
  same way the replay path does (#1694, #1739, #1743).
- **Thinking-only turns no longer disappear.** If a clean turn ends with
  thinking but no final answer text, the UI now surfaces a clear status instead
  of silently ending the turn (#1727, #1742).
- **Windows `cmd /C` preserves quoted shell arguments.** Commands such as
  `git commit -m "feat: complete sub-pages"` now round-trip through the Windows
  shell wrapper without losing the quoted message (#1691, #1744).
- **Home/End are line-local inside multiline composer drafts.** The keys now
  jump to the current input line boundary before falling back to transcript
  navigation (#1748, #1749).
- **Ctrl+C restores the canceled prompt reliably.** Canceling a streaming turn
  puts the submitted prompt back in the composer and suppresses late stream
  events from drawing stale output (#1757, #1764).
- **Compaction recovers from cache-aligned summary context overflow.** When a
  cache-preserving summary request itself exceeds the provider context window,
  compaction retries with the bounded formatted summary path instead of failing
  with a 400 "compression command failed" style error.
- **Terminal sub-agent sessions expose full transcript handles.** Completed
  and canceled child agents now store the full child message transcript behind
  `transcript_handle`, so the parent can inspect details with `handle_read`
  instead of relying only on a lossy summary (#1738).
- **Forked saved sessions now keep visible lineage.** `deepseek fork` records
  the parent session id and fork-time message count in additive metadata, and
  session listings mark forked paths with their source id. This gives users a
  bounded branchable-conversation workflow while the larger visual tree browser
  stays scoped for a future release.
- **Repeated shell wait rows collapse in the Tasks sidebar.** Multiple live
  `task_shell_wait` polls for the same background job now render as one row
  with an explicit collapsed-wait count, reducing the stuck-task appearance
  tracked for v0.8.40 (#1737).
- **Leaked mouse scroll reports no longer erase composer draft suffixes.** If
  a terminal delivers raw SGR mouse bytes into the input stream, the sanitizer
  now strips only the mouse report and adjacent coordinate fragments instead
  of deleting legitimate draft text such as `commit -m` or numeric prompts
  (#1778).
- **TUI runtime logs are separated per process and pruned on startup.** Each
  session now writes `~/.deepseek/logs/tui-YYYY-MM-DD-PID.log`, and startup
  removes stale TUI logs older than seven days by default. Set
  `DEEPSEEK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` to a positive day count to adjust retention
  (#1782, #1784).
- **The offline eval harness preserves quoted Windows shell payloads.** Its
  `exec_shell` step now uses the same single-payload shape as the runtime shell
  path, with raw `cmd /C` arguments on Windows so quoted commands remain intact
  (#1779).
- **The Feishu/Lark bridge recovers better after restarts.** It now reattaches
  to persisted active turns after the long-connection client starts, and text
  chunking no longer splits emoji or other multi-code-unit characters.
- **RLM survives non-UTF-8 stdout.** `rlm_eval` now decodes REPL stdout
  lossily instead of treating a single invalid byte as a fatal crash, so
  binary-adjacent diagnostics can still return a bounded result (#1815,
  #1819).
- **Small UI/review reliability fixes landed with the stability branch.**
  `/clear` now resets all displayed cost state, grayscale theme previews avoid
  luma overflow, `/theme` picker arrow navigation wraps at the list edges, and
  encoded JSON review output is parsed before display.
- **New-file writes execute on the first Agent-mode call.** `write_file` now
  stays preloaded in Agent mode, so creating a file no longer stops at the
  deferred-tool schema hydration message before the normal approval/execution
  path (#1825, #1841).
- **Saved sessions keep the selected model mode.** Changing from `auto` to a
  concrete model now updates existing session metadata, and resumed sessions
  recompute the `auto` flag from the saved model instead of falling back to the
  startup default.
- **The `/model` picker persists thinking effort across restarts.** Selecting
  Pro/Flash plus `high`/`max`/`auto` now writes both `default_model` and
  `reasoning_effort` to `settings.toml`, and startup restores the saved effort
  before falling back to `config.toml`.
- **The footer water strip is visible by default again.** `fancy_animations`
  now defaults to `true`, while `NO_ANIMATIONS`, SSH/Termius, VS Code, Ghostty,
  and legacy terminal overrides still disable the animated strip where it is
  known to flicker.
- **Screenshots are readable without extra setup on macOS.** `image_ocr` now
  uses the native Vision framework on macOS when Tesseract is absent, and
  `read_file` routes screenshot/image reads through the same OCR path. Pasted
  clipboard screenshots saved under `~/.deepseek/clipboard-images` are trusted
  automatically for read-only tools.
- **Auto-routing context no longer leaks hidden thinking.** The model/router
  context summary now excludes `ContentBlock::Thinking`, so prior internal
  reasoning is not reintroduced as if it were visible user or assistant text.

### Changed

- **Slash-command autocomplete ranks exact alias matches first.** Typing
  `/q` now surfaces `/exit` (whose alias `q` is an exact match) above
  `/clear` (which only matches by the longer pinyin alias `qingping`).
  Within each rank tier the menu still falls back to alphabetical name
  order for deterministic display (#1811).
- **CNB mirror preflight covers stability-release branches.** The CNB sync
  path now recognizes the v0.8.40 stability branch shape before release tags
  exist, making the Tencent Lighthouse/Lark deployment path easier to verify
  before publishing.

### Thanks

Thanks to **jayzhu ([@zlh124](https://github.com/zlh124))** for the WSL2
startup report and clipboard-init fix in #1772/#1773. Thanks to **Paulo Aboim
Pinto ([@aboimpinto](https://github.com/aboimpinto))** for the Windows
alt-screen logging report and fix in #1774/#1776, and for the Home/End
composer work in #1748/#1749, plus the per-process log filename follow-up in
#1782/#1783. Thanks to **Zhongyue Lin
([@LeoLin990405](https://github.com/LeoLin990405))** for the provider model
passthrough, reasoning replay, thinking-only turn, and Windows quoting fixes
in #1740, #1743, #1742, and #1744. Thanks to **Nightt
([@nightt5879](https://github.com/nightt5879))** for the Ctrl+C prompt restore
fix in #1764. Thanks to **Ling ([@LING71671](https://github.com/LING71671);
commits as `www17 <ivonrust@gmail.com>`)** for the configurable sub-agent API
timeout in #1808 and the Agent-mode `write_file` preload fix in #1841,
harvested with `1..=1800` clamping and a fail-fast guard so a stray
`api_timeout_secs = 0` keeps the legacy 120-second default.
Thanks to **[@knqiufan](https://github.com/knqiufan)** for the sub-agent
file-write delegation work in #1833, harvested with structured approval-
gate semantics (`Implementer` and `Custom` only, never `Required`-level
tools) so write-capable children can actually land code without bypassing
the `Required` approval class. Thanks to **[@IIzzaya](https://github.com/IIzzaya)**
for the exact-alias-first slash-completion ordering idea in #1811, landed
with a focused regression test. Thanks to **Bevis** and the community reports
that surfaced the compaction failure mode addressed in this release. Thanks to
**Reid ([@reidliu41](https://github.com/reidliu41))** for the grayscale theme
overflow report and `/theme` picker edge-wrapping patch in #1814.
